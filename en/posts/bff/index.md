# Notes on Learning Calculus of Variations

{{< music url="/music/三叶(主题曲) - RADWIMPS-MengLuoRJ.m4s" name="三葉のテーマ" artist=" 君の名" cover="/images/三葉のテーマ.jpg" >}} 


I am recording these study notes because of the elegance of the calculus of variations. The reference book is "Fundamentals of Dynamic Optimization" by Alpha C. Chiang, which is a very friendly introductory textbook on dynamic optimization for economics students.

These notes are based on my quick study and personal understanding. If there are any inaccuracies, please bear with me.

## Functional

Let's start with the study of functions.

- In elementary school, we began to encounter unknowns like $x$.
- In middle school, we started to learn about specific functions like $f(x) = ax + bx^2 + c$.
- In high school, we began to understand abstract functions like $f(x) = f(-x)$ and $f'(x) = f(x)$.
- In university, we started to learn about implicit functions like $y' = y + y''$, which solve a class of functions.

As our study of functions moves from concrete to abstract, we begin to develop the ability to **infer the form of a function based on its properties**.

> **Nonlinear functionals** in functional analysis are functions of functions. Given specific functional characteristics, we can narrow down the range of functional forms and then select the optimal function based on constraints.

>
> Previously, given a specific type of function, we sought extremum points;
>
> Now, given functional characteristics, we seek the best specific function.

Generally, the characteristic constraints of a function can be expressed as $f(t, y(t), y'(t))$, which can be understood as $f(\text{time}, \text{state}, \text{direction})$.

As shown in the figure below, there are three functions from $a$ to $b$ that satisfy the functional characteristics. Which one is the optimal? This introduces the use of calculus to find the extremum of the functional path.

![Functions satisfying constraints](/img/变分法速通.zh-cn-20240523094828444.webp)
$$
V(t) = \int_0^T f(t, y, y') dt
$$
As the functional form $y$ changes, $V(t)$ also changes. This is the starting point of functional analysis. We aim to find the optimal path $y^*$ from a set of functional forms $y$ by seeking the extremum of $V(t)$ and other constraints.

## Calculus of Variations

When learning about derivatives, we used the concept of approximation to find limits:
$$
\lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$
Here, we use a similar approach. Assume the optimal function is $y^\*$, and represent a class of functions near it as $y^* + \varepsilon P(t)$ .

> Note that $P(0) = P(T) = 0$

![Functional representation](/img/变分法速通.zh-cn-20240523094806341.webp)

Thus, we obtain the following expression in terms of $\varepsilon$:
$$
V(\varepsilon) = \int\_0^T F\left[t, \underbrace{y^\*(t) + \varepsilon p(t)}\_{y(t)}, \underbrace{y^\*(t) + \varepsilon p'(t)}_{y'(t)}\right] dt
$$
The first-order condition for the extremum is $\frac{dV}{d\varepsilon} = 0$.

{{< admonition tip "Derivative formula in calculus" false >}}
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \int_{g(t)}^{h(t)} F(x, t) dx = F(h, t) \frac{dh}{dt} - F(g, t) \frac{dg}{dt} + \int_{g(t)}^{h(t)} \frac{\partial F}{\partial t} dx
$$
{{< /admonition >}}
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dV}{d\varepsilon} &= \int_0^T \frac{\partial F}{\partial \varepsilon} dt = \int_0^T \left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{d\varepsilon} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y'} \frac{dy'}{d\varepsilon} \right) dt \\\\
&= \int_0^T \left[ F_y p(t) + F_{y'} p'(t) \right] dt \\\\
&= \int_0^T F_y p(t) dt + \color{red}{\int_0^T F_{y'} p'(t) dt} = 0
\end{aligned}
$$
{{< admonition tip "Local transformation" false >}}
$$
\frac{dy}{d\varepsilon} = \frac{d(y^*(t) + \varepsilon p)}{d\varepsilon} = P(t)
$$
Similarly, $\frac{dy'}{d\varepsilon} = P'(t)$

{{< /admonition >}}

Next, we transform the $\color{red}{\text{red part}}$ using integration by parts $\int\_{t=a}^{t=b} v du = vu \big|\_{t=a}^{t=b} - \int\_{t=a}^{t=b} u dv$ (where $u = u(t)$, $v = v(t)$):

$$
\begin{align}
& \color{red}{\int_0^T F\_{y'} p'(t) dt} \\\\
&= \left[ F\_{y'} p(t) \right]_0^T - \int\_0^T p(t) \frac{d}{dt} F\_{y'} dt \\\\
&= -\int\_0^T p(t) \frac{d}{dt} F\_{y'} dt \\\\
& (\text{Because } P(0) = P(T) = 0\\\\
& \text{ see the image of the perturbation function } P(t))
\end{align}
$$


Substituting the $\color{red}{\text{red part}}$ back, we get:
$$
\int_0^T p(t) \left[ F_y - \frac{d}{dt} F_{y'} \right] dt = 0
$$
Considering that the perturbation function $P(t)$ can be any function, the only way for the above equation to be zero is if $F_y - \frac{d}{dt} F_{y'} = 0$.

Thus, we obtain the **Euler equation**:
$$
F_y - \frac{d}{dt} F_{y'} = 0, \quad t \in [0, T]
$$
When the equation constraint only involves three variables, i.e., $F(t, y, y')$, it can be expanded as:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dF_{y'}}{dt} &= \frac{\partial F_{y'}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial F_{y'}}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dt} + \frac{\partial F_{y'}}{\partial y'} \frac{dy'}{dt} \\\\
&= F_{ty'} + F_{yy'} y'(t) + F_{y'y'} y''(t)
\end{aligned}
$$
Expanding, we get:
$$
F_{y'y'} y''(t) + F_{yy'} y'(t) + F_{ty'} - F_y = 0, \quad t \in [0, T]
$$

{{< admonition tip "A problem" false >}}
Given the functional $V(y) = \int_0^2 (12ty + y'^2) dt$

The general solution to the Euler equation is $y^*(t) = t^3 + c_1 t + c_2$

{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition tip "Extensions of the Euler equation" false >}}

Here, we only mention the extensions without further elaboration.

When the functional $F$ contains only some variables, such as $F(t, y')$, $F(y, y')$, or $F(t, y)$, there are shortcut methods for each case.

The core of the Euler equation is $F_y - \frac{d}{dt} F_{y'} = 0, \quad t \in [0, T]$

When the functional $F$ contains multiple variables or higher-order variables, the core remains the same, but further expansion is needed.

## The Catenary Problem

Imagine a red string hanging between two poles for drying clothes.

Establish a coordinate system and rotate this string around the x-axis. What curvature should the string have to minimize the surface area of the resulting solid?

![Even a humble clothesline has profound principles](/img/变分法速通.zh-cn-20240523094744425.webp)

Consider the Pythagorean theorem for a differential element:
$$
(ds)^2 = (dx)^2 + (dy)^2
$$
We can obtain the differential of the curve:
$$
\frac{ds}{dt} = \sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2} = (1 + y'^2)^{1/2}
$$
By differentiating along the curve, the integral of the circumference of each differential circle ($2\pi r$) gives the surface area after rotation.

Thus, we obtain the following functional:
$$
V(t) = \int_0^T 2\pi y ds = 2\pi \int_0^T y (1 + y'^2)^{1/2} dt
$$
Simplifying the expression:
$$
V(t) = \int_0^T y (1 + y'^2)^{1/2} dt
$$
Using the Euler equation, we get:
$$
y (1 + y'^2)^{1/2} - y y'^2 (1 + y'^2)^{-1/2} = c
$$
Simplifying (by rationalizing the denominator and squaring to eliminate the square root in the denominator), we obtain:
$$
y' \left( \equiv \frac{dy}{dt} \right) = \frac{1}{c} \sqrt{y^2 - c^2}
$$
Which is:
$$
\frac{c dy}{\sqrt{y^2 - c^2}} = dt
$$
Integrating, we get:
$$
\int \frac{c dy}{\sqrt{y^2 - c^2}} = c \ln \left( \frac{y + \sqrt{y^2 - c^2}}{c} \right) + c_1 = \int dt = t + c_2
$$
Rearranging the above expression and combining the two arbitrary constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ into $k$, we obtain the general solution:
$$
y^*(t) = \frac{c}{2} \left[ e^{(t + k)/c} + e^{-(t + k)/c} \right]
$$
And the [catenary curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary) is of the form:
$$
y = \frac{1}{2} (e^t + e^{-t})
$$

## The Brachistochrone Problem

Imagine a marble race with three different slides. A contestant has only one chance to choose. Which slide should they choose for the marble to reach the finish line the fastest?

![Yes, even slides hide profound principles](/img/变分法速通.zh-cn-20240804223058150.webp)

Using the conservation of energy, we get:
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2} m v^2 &= m g y \\
v &= \sqrt{2 g y}
\end{align}
$$
In the catenary problem, we introduced the differential of the curve as $ds = (1 + y'^2)^{1/2} dt$.

Thus, considering velocity as the derivative of distance with respect to time:
$$
v = \frac{ds}{dt} = \sqrt{1 + y'^2} \frac{dx}{dt}
$$
Combining the above equations:
$$
\begin{cases}
v = \sqrt{2 g y} \\
v = \sqrt{1 + y'^2} \frac{dx}{dt}
\end{cases}
$$
We obtain:
$$
dt = \frac{\sqrt{1 + y'^2}}{\sqrt{2 g y}} dx
$$
The target functional seeks the minimum total time:
$$
T = \int dt = \int \frac{\sqrt{1 + y'^2}}{\sqrt{2 g y}} dx
$$
Using the Euler equation, we get:
$$
2 y'' y + y'^2 + 1 = 0
$$
For the complete solution, refer to [A Brief Discussion on the Calculus of Variations](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/139018146), which also mentions other mathematicians' solutions to this problem.

In any case, one form of the solution is (where $a$ and $c$ are arbitrary constants):
$$
\begin{cases}
x = a (\theta - \sin \theta) + c \\
y = a (1 - \cos \theta)
\end{cases}
$$

## Monopoly Economics Problem

Consider a monopoly firm with a profit function written as $F(P, P')$.

> The economic meaning is that the monopoly firm has the power to set prices.

The functional is then:
$$
V = \int F(P, P') dt
$$
Substituting into the Euler equation, we get:
$$
F_{P'P'} P'' + F_{PP'} P' - F_P = 0
$$
Solving this implicit function requires some clever manipulation. Multiply both sides by $P'$ and then rearrange:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{d}{dt} (P' F_{P'} - F) \\\\
& = \frac{d}{dt} (P' F_{P'}) - \frac{d}{dt} F(P, P') \\\\
& = F_{P'} P'' + P' \left( F_{PP'} P' + F_{P'P'} P'' \right) - \left( F_P P' + F_{P'} P'' \right) \\\\
& = P' \color{red}{\left( F_{P'P'} P'' + F_{PP'} P' - F_P \right)}
\end{aligned}
$$
The red part is the original equation.

Thus, we obtain:
$$
F - P' F_{P'} = c
$$
Where $c$ is a constant. Writing $F$ as the common profit function $\pi$, we get:
$$
\pi - P' \frac{\partial \pi}{\partial P'} = c
$$
Considering [static monopoly](https://etcnew.sdut.edu.cn/meol/analytics/resPdfShow.do;jsessionid=D8B075E94531C56DA0F681D5260DFCF9?resId=1084894&lid=52541), the monopoly firm makes only one pricing decision (more detailed static game theory also considers product differentiation, information asymmetry, game sequence, and firm entry/exit states).

In this case, the profit function only depends on $P$ and not on $P'$ (since there is only one pricing decision, no price change occurs). Clearly, $P' \frac{\partial \pi}{\partial P'} = 0$, so $\pi_s = c$.

Now, consider dynamic game theory on top of static game theory. After the first pricing decision, monopoly firms begin to make multiple pricing decisions. The profit function is now:
$$
\pi - P' \frac{\partial \pi}{\partial P'} = \pi_s
$$
Here, the profit function $\pi$ must depend on both $P$ and $P'$. Thus, consider the elasticity of $\pi$ with respect to $P'$, denoted as:
$$
\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial P'} \frac{P'}{\pi} = \varepsilon_{\pi P'}
$$
Substituting into the dynamic monopoly game formula, we get:
$$
\varepsilon_{\pi P'} = 1 - \frac{\pi_\varepsilon}{\pi}
$$
In other words, in dynamic monopoly, firms should continuously adjust their profit functions based on this relationship.
