Since childhood, I have had many types of dreams:
- **Precognitive Dreams**: Dreaming of the next day's school poetry competition dictation questions.
- **Lucid Dreams**: Being in overlapping white staircases, realizing it's a dream, but still unable to control it, just walking blindly.
- **Recurring Dreams**: From elementary to middle school, I repeatedly dreamed of walking on the ridges of southern water fields in my hometown. There was a chest-deep pit in the path, and falling into it, I could feel the slithering sensation of giant pythons around me. (I suspect it was because I was young and the blanket was too heavy, so I kept dreaming of it.)

Today's dream was the most complete and lengthy, with a strong sense of storytelling. Now that AI is available, why not compare AI interpretations?

## Dream Description

Last night, I had a nested dream.

A relative girl poured loaches into the basin where I had placed water. I suddenly became agitated, remembering that there was a small snake I had raised in it. I frantically reminded the relative not to squeeze out my pet snake. As the water filled up, the snake disappeared.

I felt that this was the second time I had lost a pet snake, but I couldn't recall the first time—only the painful feeling of loss.

I kept trying to convince my family that such a snake had existed (I was using the **past tense** to describe it, which might be a key point). On a stone table in the classic neighborhood grove, I kept telling them all my memories, but could only recall some vague landmarks.

I searched everywhere, retrieving memories from the trash bin, the police station, and the museum.

**Trash Bin Memory**: On my way to school, I found a transparent small box inside a larger box, containing a talking snake! I also remembered that the trash bin was divided into recyclable and non-recyclable, a world that seemed omnipotent. She was actually a talking snake. The snake and I watched videos and吐槽 together. But I couldn't remember how it came to be, only fragmented memories of life.

**Police Station**: I was parentless, driving a second-hand Changan truck collecting garbage. The Changan's window was broken, patched with yellow tape, and the trunk couldn't lock, so I propped it open with a support to load junk and goods. The snake turned out to be a descendant of Bai Suzhen's lineage, an experimental subject. I was caught in the pursuit of an evil force, and the police were helping me.

**Museum**: The evil force was conducting biological experiments in pursuit of mythical power. The snake sacrificed itself to save me, incidentally erasing my memory. Her final words were—there should not be a talking snake in the world. Forgetting her would be better for both me and the world.

I remembered everything and woke up.

## AI Interpretations

### Tongyi Qianwen

Your dream is very complex and full of symbolic meanings, possibly reflecting some deep-seated emotions and unresolved issues in your subconscious. Dreams are usually expressions of our subconscious. Here are some possible interpretations:

1. **Loss and Retrieval**: The recurring theme of losing the pet snake and the process of searching for it may express your fear of losing important relationships or things. You mentioned that this was the "second time" you lost the pet snake but couldn't recall the first time, which might hint at a past experience of loss that was very painful for you.

2. **Trash Bin Memory**: This part seems to suggest that you found something precious (the talking snake) in an unexpected place, symbolizing the value you find in ordinary or overlooked things. The "recyclable and non-recyclable" world might represent your views on resource utilization or your attempt to give new meaning to seemingly useless things in life.

3. **Police Station Scene**: The image of driving a second-hand Changan truck collecting garbage might be a self-deprecating or humble reflection of your life status. The pursuit and police assistance could reflect the pressures or challenges you face in real life and your need for external help.

4. **Museum Memory**: This involves mythological elements (like Bai Suzhen) and scientific experiments, as well as the act of choosing to forget to protect others. This might indicate that you are facing similar choices in real life—sometimes having to make sacrifices or give up something for the safety and happiness of yourself or others.

5. **Overall Dream Structure**: The entire dream seems like a story about growth, responsibility, love, and sacrifice. It might be telling you that despite the many difficulties and uncertainties in life, you have the strength to face them, and sometimes you must accept certain events, even if it means enduring some loss.

Of course, this is just a general analysis based on the dream content you provided. Everyone's experiences are unique, so the most accurate understanding should come from yourself. If you feel that this dream has had a particular impact on you, consider whether it touches on certain aspects of your recent life or if there is anything specific that is troubling you. If necessary, you can also try exploring the meanings behind these dreams further through journaling or drawing.

### GPT (4-O)

This is a dream full of symbolic meanings, with layered plots and emotions that seem to explore deeply hidden secrets in the subconscious. Here are some possible interpretations:

1. **Symbolism of the Snake**  
    The snake might represent a part of your inner self—innocent, fragile, yet full of wisdom and power. This snake can talk, help you吐槽, solve problems, and even sacrifice itself to protect you, showing that it is not just a pet but also a spiritual companion or guide.
    
2. **Loss and Search**  
    In the dream, you keep losing and searching for the snake, which might hint at the loss of some important emotion or memory in reality. This repeated loss and retrieval might correspond to a process of losing and trying to regain yourself in a certain situation.
    
3. **Trash Bin, Police Station, and Museum**  
    These locations each have deep meanings:
    
    - **Trash Bin**: Symbolizes parts of life that are neglected or discarded. Finding memories there suggests the need to revisit past experiences or emotions that have been forgotten.
    - **Police Station**: Represents order and protection, but your experience in the dream is full of破碎 and pursuit, possibly reflecting your矛盾心理 towards authority or real-world rules.
    - **Museum**: As a repository of memories, it reveals the truth about the snake, the evil force, and the sacrifice, seemingly reminding you that some truths from the past need to be accepted or let go.
4. **Sacrifice and Memory Erasure**  
    The snake's sacrifice and erasure of your memory carry a strong tragic tone, perhaps reflecting your subconscious复杂情感 towards "forgetting." On one hand, forgetting might be a form of self-protection; on the other, it comes with deep loss.
    
5. **Feeling After Waking Up**  
    You woke up after remembering everything in the dream, as if completing an internal integration in the subconscious. When memories, emotions, and truths converge, you achieve clarity—whether from the dream or some psychological困境.
    

If this is a source of creative inspiration, the dream's plot is very suitable as the mainline of a suspense story, especially regarding the symbolism of the snake, the conspiracy behind the experiments, and the protagonist's growth. You could further expand it, adding more characters and background details to make it a fantastical and touching work.

### Personal Interpretation

I don't understand the relationship between dream interpretation, desires, and the subconscious, but based on past dreams and my own experiences, I should be able to sense where the dream materials come from.

The most amazing part of this nested dream is that the development of the dream corresponds to the foreshadowing earlier. But how can a dream have foreshadowing? How can it set up a呼应 framework in advance? This sense of design is astonishing.

**Snake**: Since childhood, I've had many dreams about snakes. Although they are terrifying to me, I also find them somewhat positive because my zodiac sign is the snake. In *The Lion King*, *Kung Fu Panda*, and *The Legend of the White Snake*, snakes are portrayed positively, and there's an ancient saying about snakes transforming into dragons.

**Talking Snake**: Recently, I had a lot of discussions with classmates during a gathering, and writing my thesis also requires active communication with the team. Indeed, I have many thoughts on social interaction, communication, and barriers. I believe sincere communication is important, but sincere communication doesn't mean others will believe you are sincere. This process is like the prisoner's dilemma—the more it goes on, the higher others' defenses against sincerity become.

**Museum**: My favorite city attraction has always been museums. I believe in the power of museums—human history, dignity, and monuments. It's fitting to retrieve memories in a museum. The police station is just something we, as Chinese, fully trust.

**Garbage, Changan Truck**: My family is very harmonious. The scavenging and parentless aspects are classic anime settings. In my hometown, Changan trucks are often used for transporting goods.

**Forgetting, Sacrifice**: Classic scenes from films like *Your Name*. At this stage, my dreams still have such情节,看来我还是挺向往童真的😄. The most impressive part of this dream is the realism of失忆 and寻找, and finally remembering everything gave a sense of fate.

**Desire**: In this dream, I could clearly sense that the snake's gender was female. Could it really be a reflection of desire? But I know that such an image is an ideal embodiment, just like the me on the blog is only a partial me. Anyone in reality is diverse and complete. To comprehend the abstract and sacred aspects of human nature, but in the pursuit, one must embrace the whole and concrete person.
