**Time: March 2024. Flight arrives in Wuhan at 11 a.m., next flight departs at 5:10 p.m., with a 6 hour 50 minute transfer time.**

Wuhan is one of the important transfer hubs in China, with many flights having long layovers. The Yellow Crane Tower in Wuhan is famous worldwide and is directly connected by subway to the airport. During a layover, you might as well pay a quick visit to the Yellow Crane Tower.

## I. Airport Preparation

Follow the WeChat account "Transfer Passenger Service" —— Transfer services offer free transfer meals and luggage storage. You can also book transfer luggage straight through (seamless托运).

- **Luggage Straight Through:** Requires advance booking and allows seamless transfer of luggage.
- **Transfer Meal:** Click to obtain a QR code. Located in the departure hall outside security, at the end of corridor A, the restaurant can be used, and a meal voucher worth 30 yuan or a souvenir can be redeemed. I chose the "Food Pavilion" 30 yuan chicken set meal, which also came with an egg and soy milk. My同行ordered a 26 yuan hot dry noodles set (completely lost compared to the chicken set meal!).

This quick visit did not use the luggage straight through service. After landing at 11 a.m., retrieving luggage, storing it, and finishing lunch, it was exactly 12 p.m.

## II. Subway to the Yellow Crane Tower

Subway route: Take line rail transit → Jiyuqiao → Peng Liu Yang subway exit → walk to the Yellow Crane Tower.

Peng Liu Yang subway exit: Both exits A and C lead directly to the Yellow Crane Tower. Exit C is recommended as it is the location of the Internet celebrity wall.

At 12 p.m., board the airport subway, and arrive at the Yellow Crane Tower entrance at 1:10 p.m.
