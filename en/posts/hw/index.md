# Everything You Need to Know About Huawei Member Day


## Everything You Need to Know About Huawei Member Day

I experienced Huawei Member Day at the authorized store in Wudaokou, and here’s everything I know.

### 1. Huawei Member Day Schedule:

**The first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of every month.** If the end of the previous month falls on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, it will be postponed by one week. If you’re unsure, you can search for "20xx (year) Huawei Member Day," as shown in the link below:

For example, today, July 7, 2023, is the result of a one-week postponement.

### 2. Do I Need to Make an Appointment?

Under normal circumstances, **on-site appointments** should be fine, as Member Day happens every month and isn’t usually crowded. However, I originally planned to go in June, but the "Huawei Terminal Customer Service" (official account for advance booking) was fully booked, so I didn’t go. In July, I made on-site appointments, and there weren’t many people. (Probably because it’s been too hot in Beijing recently.)

After making an online or on-site appointment, you’ll get a number, and you can go to the corresponding service counter when your number is called.

### 3. What Services Are Available on Member Day?

**1. Free Screen Protector Application**: **Soft films are free, while hard films cost 99 RMB—so the staff will try to upsell you on the hard film.**

**2. Free Computer Cleaning.**

*Note: Not all stores have the authority to disassemble computers, so smaller stores may only offer free screen protector replacement.*

**3. Free Labor Costs for Phone Repairs.**

> For example, replacing a battery only costs the price of the battery (99 RMB or 129 RMB). If you go on other days, there may be additional labor fees. It’s best to make an appointment in advance for battery replacement so the staff can prepare the battery for your specific phone model.

### 4. On-Site Experience

Phone and computer repairs usually take about an hour, so you can pass the time by checking out the display products.

There are other products to experience on-site, such as Huawei watches, tablets, earphones, and phones.

> However, **these devices are locked with system and hardware locks, so they only display promotional content. You can probably only kill about 10 minutes here**, so I recommend exploring the nearby area.

**Bread and mints are provided**, but I was too shy to take any. There might also be a TV playing some boring programs.

There are sofas in the waiting area where you can sit, and there might be charging cables available for free.

### 5. Which Stores Are Recommended?

**I’m located in Haidian District, Beijing.**

At the time, I was choosing between Zhongguancun, Wudaokou, and Wanliu.

I first went to Wanliu (because I heard about the "Wanliu Young Master" incident and wanted to check it out), but it was a small store without the capability to clean computers, and they didn’t have the battery for my phone model!!!

**So either go to Wudaokou or Zhongguancun! That’s the advantage of big stores!**

**Between the two, I recommend Wudaokou, as it’s one of the few nightlife spots in Haidian.**

**Below the Wudaokou store is the Zhan Tianyou "Jingzhang Railway" Heritage Park, where you can spend some time exploring.**

### 6. About Zhan Tianyou "Jingzhang Railway" Heritage Park

The security guards are very friendly and willing to explain the park layout to visitors. Note that bicycles can ride on the red track and asphalt road, but cycling is prohibited in the main part of the park. Incidentally, there is a strong holdout at the Qinghuayuan Station site within the park.
