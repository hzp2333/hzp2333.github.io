# International Economic Journal RSS Feeds

## Flow Conservation List:

Personal opinion: Many articles in JLE and JPE, both affiliated with the University of Chicago, are quite enticing based on their titles alone. Research on labor economics, including marriage, gender, and wages, is particularly intriguing. Moreover, labor economics has always been the pinnacle of endogeneity treatment in both ideology and technique. Political economy, lacking a specific focus, covers a wide range of research topics. Almost everyone can find what they are looking for within it.

## Foreign journals rss

Sometimes, when official journal websites do not provide RSS feeds but you still wish to follow them, you can utilize academic paper platforms to capture their RSS feeds. You can visit platforms like **Elsevier's Journal Navigator** to find the journals you're interested in and subscribe to their RSS feeds.

[Elsevier](https://www.sciencedirect.com/)

**Indeed, the drawback of such indirect subscriptions is that they often only provide titles without abstracts, dates, or author information.**

**Terence Tao's Blog**

At the time, I was particularly curious about how Terence Tao was using GPT in mathematical research. This curiosity arose because the United States was soliciting opinions on managing AI at that time.

**Greg Mankiw's Blog**: Yes, that's the same person who authored the textbooks "Macroeconomics" and "Principles of Economics."
