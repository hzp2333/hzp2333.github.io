            </div>GPT: The text discusses the decomposition of wages throughout individuals lifecycles using the APC (Age-Period-Cohort) panel model and the Heckman-Lochner-Taber (HLT) approach. The Mincer earnings function forms the basis for this analysis, focusing on the relationships between education level, work experience, and wages. However, traditional decompositions face challenges due to collinearity between age, birth year, and current year. Deatons method addresses this by isolating time and cohort effects, allowing for separate analysis. The HLT approach further dissects wage growth, suggesting that as individuals near retirement, wage growth is primarily influenced by the time effect rather than human capital investment. This comprehensive approach aims to better understand wage dynamics over the course of individuals lives, incorporating factors such as education, work experience, age, and cohort effects.]]></description>
