A simple problem can also evolve into a broader perspective: When agricultural taxes were in place, villagers cared about local infrastructure because it was their own money at stake. After the tax was abolished and the government took over, villagers no longer paid attention. Local officials, afraid of making mistakes, also became indifferent. As a result, nail houses emerged, and removing them required stronger local forces, leading to the rise of local power factions. Thus, we find that the tax structure influenced the power structure, and agricultural taxes may have contributed to the emergence of local malevolent forces.

What I truly appreciate is the thematic crescendo in the cases throughout the first three games. First Layer: The Lawyer’s Stance—Pursuing Innocence. At this stage, the focus is on letting the evidence speak, fighting to the end, and never giving up on the defense. Second Layer: Introducing the Prosecution—Pursuing Truth and Trust. After the groundwork is laid in the first game, the lawyer appears as a towering figure. But what about the prosecution, responsible for securing convictions? The lawyer seeks to prove innocence, while the prosecution seeks to prove guilt. It’s through this clash over the same piece of evidence that a more objective perspective is gained. Thus, the truth is born from the battle between guilt and innocence. The key to the courtroom system is ensuring that both sides place their trust in it. When both parties adhere to their convictions, truth emerges from their collision. Third Layer: The Player’s Own Ethical Perspective. Though the story takes place in a fictional world, ethical philosophy often shines brightest in thought experiments. In the game, the pursuit of innocence by the player usually leads to a happy ending. But what happens when innocence is tied to a bad ending? This is the “contradiction” that the lawyer faces. Innocence that wounds the heart versus guilt that comforts it—the game presents the dilemma without offering a clear answer. (But the bonds of friendship still ignite a classic, heartwarming fire!)

We set off at 3 a.m., walking along the national highway beside the guesthouse. After spotting a tourism signpost, we found Yang Qilang’s tomb and temple nearby. Passing through the temple, we reached a dirt path leading into the mountains. The stone-brick road of the Great Wall was mostly in ruins, with only the bricks near the beacon towers remaining relatively intact. Starting from this point was particularly memorable because of the presence of a train tunnel. The first relatively complete beacon tower we arrived at.

Personal Reflections: Addressing climate change is indeed urgent. Gubei Water Town is blessed with ample water resources, with most of its land being irrigated fields, including many paddy fields. However, villagers reported that since 2018, the water levels have been declining annually, leading to many irrigated fields being converted into forested areas due to the decreasing water levels. The suburbs of Beijing aren’t much different from my hometown. It is generally believed that poorer areas tend to favor sons over daughters, but here, due to men’s jobs being insufficient to support a family and the bride price system, people actually feel it’s better to have daughters. The attitude of the residents reflects the quality of governance. In areas with rampant corruption, villagers clearly distrusted us, feeling that despite all the surveys, nothing changes: “We common folks, no matter how much we talk, it doesn’t help.” In well-governed areas with good welfare, every response was filled with gratitude towards the state, with villagers willing to comply with any government directives. I realized I am indeed quite careless! My fellow classmates, especially the female students, were much more meticulous than I was. Their questionnaire filling and reviewing were more rigorous, and I should learn from them. Survey Methods: Elderly party members and enthusiastic grandmothers make the best interviewees—they are attentive, sincere, and willing to actively cooperate with door-to-door surveys. When it comes to income-related surveys, respondents often understate their wealth. In such cases, it is important to observe the room (decoration, presence of a car, size, quality of furniture, etc.) and learn to ask disaggregated questions. For example, break down farming into the yield per mu, the number of mu farmed, and the price per jin. Similarly, use cross-verification by asking unexpected questions. For instance, when calculating income and expenses separately, ensure they balance. For household expenses, consider the number of family members and their consumption. When respondents are uncertain, set ranges—do you have 100 yuan? 200 yuan? The answers to questions can easily be manipulated. For example, asking if villagers come together to discuss solutions when faced with difficulties will invariably get a positive response. However, asking specific questions reveals more. After a recent storm in Beijing knocked down trees in many parks and schools, asking about the storm’s impact on their fields and if they sought collective solutions will likely reveal that everyone managed their own fields independently. Village-household integration. When implementing subsidy programs at the village level, the approach is often straightforward and crude. For example, the distinction between reforestation and ecological public welfare forests is blurred for villagers, who view both as tree planting for money. Subsidies are divided into planting subsidies and other types, but in the village, they are distributed together, making farmers think they get money just for planting. To address this, policies need to be broken down and explained in conjunction with villagers’ responses. Praise should be moderate. Each questionnaire typically takes about an hour5. To ensure cooperation, we often praise the respondents during the interview. However, if the praise is excessive, some attitudinal questions may receive overly positive responses, distorting the results. Moreover, for questions about marital harmony or neighborly relations, unless asked about neighbors, personal responses tend to be uniformly positive.

Therefore, as Lu Zhishen said, “Only today do I realize who I am,” and I believe he meant precisely this. The best TV shows often feature this twist, much like a marvelous painting, whose stunning exterior alone is enough to captivate viewers. However, if the underlying structure and concepts can move people further, it truly becomes art. The discussion on fate in 2023 could cater to both the chroniclers and the absurdists.

But as readers, we discover the relationship between “people and the world.” When confronted with the insignificance of individuals in an era beyond their comprehension, fate is simply glossed over. Journey to the West (sff)\rMost people question fate, receiving answers such as “There is only relative fairness, not absolute fairness,” “Heroism is still loving the world even after seeing its true nature,” and “The world kisses me with pain, and I return the favor with song.” At this point, the truth is irrelevant; what matters is maintaining a positive attitude toward survival, regardless of whether it’s right or wrong. When one insists on researching the relationship between individuals and the tides of the times, these answers are insufficient[^1]. Either one falls into madness or learns to compromise—accepting everything, living for tomorrow, and looking forward. This is the philosophy of survival: some things are proven to be unattainable, yet there’s an itch to obtain them.

What are the causal frameworks? Today, with numerous causal frameworks emerging and various disciplines such as statistics (including pharmacology and psychology, each with its own statistical interpretation), economics, and computer science having their own schools of thought, the landscape has become intricate and diverse. It is intertwined and complex, and I am not entirely sure about the overall system. Personally, I have been exposed to Judea Pearl’s Structural Causal Model (SCM) the most. Regarding his work “The Book of Why,”1 My personal understanding is that association-intervention-counterfactual represents the three levels of causality. The selection of control variables controls for backdoor paths, while setting instrumental variables controls for frontdoor paths. Correlation does not imply causation; correlation does not discuss directionality. Causality is unidirectional, so we need directed acyclic graphs to guide us. After identifying pathways, we then analyze to envision a counterfactual world.\rThe knowledge about ATE (Average Treatment Effect), ATT (Average Treatment Effect for the Treated), ITT (Intention-to-Treat), and LATE (Local Average Treatment Effect) appears sporadically in “Mostly Harmless Econometrics” 1. The entire framework is based on Donald Rubin’s proposal of the Potential Outcome Framework (also known as Rubin Causal Model, abbreviated as RCM). It’s interesting that Judea Pearl (in “The Book of Why”) proposes that counterfactuals under causal pathways are the same as Rubin’s concept of “potential outcomes.” However, Rubin responded that the two are completely different 2and does not endorse the analysis method of path diagrams. (Personally, I find it difficult to understand Rubin’s response, as in my view, the direction of arrows in SCM corresponds to the direction of addition and subtraction signs in RCM). As far as I know, causal analysis in statistics is currently divided into frequentist and Bayesian schools of thought. Research is conducted to understand causal inference through Markov chains. Personally, I am quite unfamiliar with this area of knowledge. My understanding of this topic mainly comes from educational videos by Fmajor on Bilibili. 2. More details about RCM ATE (Average Treatment Effect), ATT (Average Treatment Effect for the Treated), ITT (Intention-to-Treat), and LATE (Local Average Treatment Effect) are different statistical estimators.

However, this type of group comparison is just the starting point for causal discussions. It is necessary to further decompose these group differences to explore causal relationships. Average Treatment Effect (ATE): The difference between the means of two groups is directly used as the estimator. It can be considered as the difference between the population means or as the mean difference between groups (e.g., in the estimation of twin data): $$\\bar Y_1-\\bar Y_0=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{Y_{i}(1)-Y_{i}(0)}{N}$$ Treating $D_i$ as the treatment variable, where $D_i = 1$ represents the experimental group and $D_i = 0$ represents the control group, the linear equation is as follows: $$\\begin{align}Y_{i}\u0026=\\begin{cases} Y_{1i} \\quad if D_i = 1 \\newline Y_{0i} \\quad if D_i = 0 \\end{cases} \\newline \u0026=Y_{0i}+(Y_{1i}-Y_{0i})D_{i} \\end{align}$$ Subtracting the two equations, we obtain the following expression: $$\\begin{aligned} \u0026\\mathbf{E}[Y_{i}\\mid D_{i}=1]-\\mathbf{E}[Y_{i}\\mid D_{i}=0]\\newline\u0026 =\\color{red}{\\underbrace{\\mathbf{E}\\lfloor Y_{1i}\\mid D_{i}=1\\rfloor-\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]}_{\\text{ATT}} } \\newline \u0026+\\underbrace{\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]-\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=0]}_{SelectionBias} \\end{aligned}$$ Where $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]$ is intentionally introduced by us, representing another “parallel universe” that we wish to explore but cannot directly observe—assuming that the subgroup represented by $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{\\color{blue}{1i}}\\mid D_{i}=1]$ did not receive the treatment in the parallel world. Their state is denoted as $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{\\color{blue}{0i}}\\mid D_{i}=1]$, which is the “potential outcome” that Rubin aims to find. $\\color{red}{\\mathbf{E}\\left[ Y_{1i}\\mid D_{i}=1 \\right] - \\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]}$ represents the Average Treatment Effect on Treated (ATT). There is no better controlled experiment than “a binary choice splitting into two parallel universes”, but no one can truly obtain such data! Therefore, economists attempt to estimate ATT through ATE, hence the introduction of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). ","date":"2024-02-28","objectID":"/en/posts/effect/:1:0","tags":["Literature Review","Causal Effec"],"title":"Causal Effec","uri":"/en/posts/effect/"},{"categories":["Economic Study"],"content":"RCT: Making ATE approach ATT RCT stands for Randomized Controlled Trial, representing a randomized experiment. Under the conditions of a randomized experiment, ATE = ATT. Next, let’s delve into the explanation: Subtracting the subgroup $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]$ from the subgroup that has never received treatment in the real world $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=0]$, if the result is non-zero, selection bias occurs. The reason may be sampling selection bias: for example, conducting a fitness-related survey only at gyms would definitely not achieve effective comparison; another example is the well-known survivorship bias in the military, where the returned planes are the ones that survived, making it unreliable to estimate the areas that need reinforcement based on their damages. It could also be self-selection bias: for example, an uneven gender ratio in admissions does not necessarily indicate discrimination, as this analysis overlooks the gender ratio in application tendencies. Some genders may be more inclined to apply for more challenging positions, leading to higher rejection rates; police enforcement focusing more on a certain race does not necessarily imply discrimination, as it may simply reflect higher crime rates within that race. Omitted variables, model errors, measurement errors, and insufficient sample size can all contribute to bias. If we use the method of randomized trials, the samples are randomly distributed. We hope that this randomized trial can average out some unobserved influencing variables, thereby making $D_i$ and $Y_{0i}$ independent, which means $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]=\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=0]=\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}]$. At this point, the estimation of ATE has been effectively simplified: $$\\begin{aligned} \u0026\\mathbf{E}[Y_{1i}\\mid D_{i}=1]-\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]\\newline\u0026=ATT =\\mathbf{E}[\\mathbf{Y}_{1i}-\\mathbf{Y}_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1] \\newline \u0026=ATE=\\mathbf{E}[Y_{1i}-Y_{0i}] \\end{aligned}$$ Further estimating through regression equations: $$\\begin{align}Y_{i}\u0026=\\begin{cases} Y_{1i} \\quad if D_i = 1 \\newline Y_{0i} \\quad if D_i = 0 \\end{cases} \\newline \u0026=Y_{0i}+(Y_{1i}-Y_{0i})D_{i} \\newline \u0026 =\\alpha+\\rho D_i+\\eta_i \\end{align}$$ $$\\begin{aligned}\u0026\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[Y_i\\mid D_i=1]=\\alpha+\\rho+\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[\\eta_i\\mid D_i=1]\\newline \u0026\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[Y_i\\mid D_i=0]=\\alpha+\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[\\eta_i\\mid D_i=0]\\end{aligned}$$ We can obtain the difference between the two. $$\\begin{aligned}\u0026\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[Y_i\\mid D_i=1]-\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[Y_i\\mid D_i=0]\\newline \u0026=\\underbrace{\\rho}_\\text{Treatment effect}+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[\\eta_i\\mid D_i=1]-\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[\\eta_i\\mid D_i=0]}_\\text{secletion bias}\\end{aligned}$$ When there is selection bias $\\eta_i \\neq 0$, it means that the residual is correlated with $D_i$. We emphasize randomized trials because we hope that random intervention experiments can make the two unrelated, eliminating this selection bias. So when randomized trials are satisfied, $\\eta_i=0$, $ATE \\xrightarrow{RCT} ATT$. This also tells us why we should pay attention to residual analysis.

Although randomized intervention trials are useful, the variables we want to study are not always randomly distributed. For example, industrial land tends to aggregate around certain grades of land. In this case, buyers are not randomly distributed. In such scenarios, we consider other randomly distributed variables that may influence their decisions. It’s more illustrative to first understand this using the path diagram of SCM: Angrist (2011) is a paper that examines the impact of participating in the Vietnam War on income. In this study, the variable of military enlistment was found to be problematic, so the author used enlistment eligibility as an instrumental variable. (Nostalgic for the era of short 6-page econometric papers) 2SLS\rClearly, there exists a process where an individual is first informed of their enlistment eligibility and then decides whether to enter the military. The ITT equation is as follows: It can be observed that the ITT estimate is quite similar to $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{i}\\mid D_{i}=1]-\\mathbf{E}[Y_{i}\\mid D_{i}=0]$, meaning that when $D_i$ and $Z_i$ are one-to-one corresponding, i.e., when $z=d$, ITT = ATE. $\\pi_N$: Regardless of whether I am eligible or not, I will never join the military. $\\pi_D$: Contrarian attitude, I will join the military if I am eligible, and I will refuse if I am not eligible. $\\pi_A$: Regardless of whether I am eligible or not, I will always join the military. $\\pi_C$: Compliance, I will join if eligible, and I will not join if not eligible. The source of the diagram is the Oxford courseware (Week 4 lecture): https://andy.egge.rs/teaching/causal_inference/\rDue to the non-random distribution of $Di$, as we are based on a sample of military personnel for statistics, we have only the following equation: $$\\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{E}[D_i=1|Z_i=0]=\\pi_A+\\pi_D\\newline \\mathbf{E}[D_i=1|Z_i=1]=\\pi_A+\\pi_C \\end{aligned}$$ In this case, we cannot estimate $\\pi_i$ separately for $\\pi_i$ , $i∈{A,C,D,N}$. However, due to the random distribution, the results will be proportional, allowing us to derive a linear equation: The solution is to make an assumption — quite reminiscent of an economics joke. Here’s the original joke: A physicist, a chemist, and an economist are stranded on a deserted island, starving. Suddenly, a can of food washes ashore. The physicist says, “We can use rocks to apply momentum to the can, causing its surface to fatigue and rupture.” The chemist says, “We can make a fire, then heat the can, causing it to expand until it bursts.” The economist then says, “Let’s assume we have a can opener…” After introducing the assumption, we directly obtain the LATE: $$\\mathrm{LATE}=\\mathrm{CATE}_{\\mathcal{C}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{ITT}}{\\pi_{\\mathcal{C}}}$$ $$\\small \\hat{\\mathbf{CATE}_C}=\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\Big[Y_i|Z_i=1\\Big]-\\mathbf{E}\\Big[Y_i|Z_i=0\\Big]}{\\mathbf{E}\\Big[D_i|Z_i=1\\Big]-\\mathbf{E}\\Big[D_i|Z_i=0\\Big]}=\\frac{\\mathrm{effect~of~}Z_i\\text{ on }Y_i}{\\mathrm{effect~of~}Z_i\\text{ on }D_i}=\\frac{\\operatorname{ITT}_Y}{\\operatorname{ITT}_D}$$ The LATE section heavily relies on the Oxford course material. For a more algebraic explanation, refer to the Harvard course material and “Mostly Harmless Econometrics.” Social science attributes in mathematical economics The social science attributes in mathematical economics are evident in the need to articulate assumptions that capture social phenomena. For instance, when studying unique policies, it’s essential to argue that the policy affects everyone, reflecting the assumption of monotonicity. Similarly, when using instrumental variables, it’s crucial to discuss the social relationship between the instrument and the explanatory variable. These assumptions serve as concise descriptions of social phenomena, highlighting the distinct social science nature of economic analysis.

Here, it is assumed that the returns to education are linear and the returns to work experience are nonlinear for the logarithmized wages. Heckman et al. (2006) empirically tested this assumption in their related research 2. Even if we don’t discuss the specific form of the equation, such a decomposition of variables is certainly insufficient. As the famous bread hunter DIO once said—— “JOJO, in the brief span of a human life, I have discovered… The more one plays with schemes, the more limited one finds the capabilities of humanity to be…” Indeed! Human lifespan and physical stages are points we cannot ignore! Once we delve into labor economics, we cannot avoid discussing human age and condition. Bread Hunter——DIO\rFirstly, let’s consider the lifecycle. Even if individuals have the same education level and work experience, or even higher, the rate of return on education varies with age. Here, we estimate parameters that are age and time-related. Moreover, the historical context in which each individual exists also influences wage earnings. For instance, movements like “going to the countryside” and “reform and opening up” deeply affected specific cohorts. Here, we estimate parameters (usually categorized by birth year) that are related to individual cohorts and time. Additionally, time effects (including economic cycles and linear growth, such as wage inflation) are also related to time! All these parameters are time-dependent! Decomposing them in the econometric equation becomes a significant challenge. Hence, we have the following extended and flexible Mincer equation. $$ln(w_{ict})=\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict}$$ $i$ represents an independent number. $c$ represents the group number, for example, one group was born during the reform and opening up, one group was born when people went to the mountains and countryside, and one cohort group 3. In the life cycle, work experience is generally divided into groups. The descriptive statistics in the figure below are preliminary descriptive statistics of the life cycle carried out by comparing groups after five years of grouping. $t$ represents the time variable. $\\theta(s_{ict})$ represents the education income function, $f(x_{ict})$ represents the work experience income function, $\\gamma_t$ represents the queue effect of group $c$, $\\chi_t$ represents the group queue Effect, $\\varepsilon_{ict}$ is the paper. Individual-level panel data is often challenging to obtain directly. Therefore, Deaton proposed: “We don’t need individual tracking panels anymore! Your room has no space left for you to obtain positions! We’ll synthesize a ‘pseudo-panel’ from repeated cross-sections of census data! Epidemiology, drug trials, social psychology, and other statistical fields all make use of such pseudo-panels. For example, in the figure below: These income comparison data are not from individual tracking panel data but rather from a pseudo-panel constructed from cross-sectional data of different ages at the same time.” Life cycle wage growth across countries(2018）\rThis type of panel data requires consideration of age, time period, and cohort as independent variables, also known as the Age-Period-Cohort Model (APC). In labor economics, the estimation of APC panel data has always been a hot topic (endorsed by the great Deaton, after all, it is a framework he established in economic analysis). For the estimation equation: $$ln(w_{ict})=\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict}$$ When we directly regress APC data, we encounter the problem of collinearity—age + birth year ","date":"2024-01-19","objectID":"/en/posts/hlt/:1:0","tags":["Literature Review","Stata"],"title":"HLT: Lifecycle and Wage Decomposition","uri":"/en/posts/hlt/"},{"categories":["Economic Study"],"content":"Deaton’s approach（mathematical Decomposition） Angus Deaton, who won the Nobel Prize in 2015 for his research on poverty, has made significant contributions to labor economics, with much discussion focused on his findings that aid may worsen conditions 4. The following method is mainly based on his work “The Analysis of Household Surveys: A Microeconometric Approach to Development Policy” (1997) (starting from page 123), to be honest, it feels a bit, well, unfriendly. For the formula: $$ln(w_{ict})=\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict}$$ Like this: $$w_{ict}=\\exp (\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict})$$ The aggregate total wage can be decomposed into sums grouped first by $c$, and within each group, summed over individuals $i$: $$\\begin{aligned} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{ct}}w_{ict}=\u0026 \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{ct}}\\exp(\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict}) \\newline \u0026=\\exp(\\alpha+\\gamma_t+\\chi_c)\\underbrace{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{ct}}\\exp(\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\varepsilon_{ict})}_{F_{ct}} \\newline \u0026=\\exp(\\alpha+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c})F_{ct} \\end{aligned}$$ $F_{ct}$ at this point represents the total wage contribution of both the education experience function $\\theta(s_{ict})$ and the work experience function $f(x_{ict})$. Define $\\bar{F}_t = \\sum*{c\\in C_t} F_{ct}$, then proceed to separate this part out, transforming it as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} W_{t}=\u0026 \\sum_{c\\in C_{t}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{ct}}w_{ict} \\newline \u0026=\\sum_{c\\in C_{t}}\\exp(\\alpha+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c})F_{ct} \\newline \u0026=\\exp(\\alpha)\\exp(\\gamma_{t})\\sum_{c\\in C_{t}}\\exp(\\chi_{c})F_{ct} \\newline \u0026=\\exp(\\alpha)\\exp(\\gamma_{t})\\bar{F}_{t}\\sum_{c\\in C_{t}}\\exp(\\chi_{c})\\frac{F_{ct}}{\\bar{F}_{t}} \\end{aligned}$$ At this point, wages can be decomposed into three parts: time effect $\\Gamma_{t}$, the effect of work experience and education $\\bar F_{t}$, and cohort effect $\\bar X_{t}$. $$W_{t}=\\underbrace{\\exp(\\gamma_{t})}_{\\Gamma_{t}}\\bar F_{t}\\underbrace{\\sum_{c\\in C_{t}}\\exp(\\chi_{c})\\frac{F_{ct}}{\\overline{F_{t}}}}_{\\tilde{X_{t}}}$$ The effects of work experience and education can be quantified through the years of education and work, but identifying the time effect and cohort effect is challenging. Therefore, the purpose of this approach is to isolate and study the time and cohort effects separately. Hence, we define: $$\\Omega_{t}=\\frac{W_t}{\\bar F_{t}}=\\Gamma_{t}\\bar{X}_{t}$$ In studying cohort and time effects, we typically approach it from two perspectives. Time trend: Our technology always advances over time, representing a time trend that progresses on average. Cyclical variations: For example, seasonal vegetables have cyclical supply and demand patterns, or the baby boom generation—when the baby boomers reach middle age, there may be a peak in the labor force. time effects\rAt this point logarithmize again—— $\\omega_t=\\log\\Omega_t,\\bar{\\chi}_t=\\log\\bar{X}_t，\\bar{\\gamma}_t=\\log\\bar{\\Gamma}_t$ ​ At the same time, it should be emphasized that what is defined is that $\\bar{\\chi}_t$ and $\\bar{\\gamma}_t$ are the deviations of the sample mean at this time. Just like we assume that the sum of residuals after regression is 0, this assumption also requires that the sum of sample mean residuals is 0: $$\\frac1T\\sum_{t=0}^T\\gamma_t=\\frac1T\\sum_{t=0}^T\\bar{\\chi}_t=0$$ At this time, the formula is decomposed into: $\\omega_t=\\bar{\\omega}+\\bar \\gamma_t+\\bar{\\chi}_t$ The original paper only stated that $\\bar{\\omega}$ is “an appropriately chosen constant”. Personally, I think it is the sample mean, so in contrast, $\\bar{\\chi}_t$ and ${\\bar \\gamma}_t$ are the deviations from the sample mean. At this time, both the time effect and the queue effect can be decomposed into time trend$g$ and periodic change $u$, which can be expressed by $gt+u$, and the following decomposition is obtained: $$\\gamma_{t}=g_{\\gamma}t+u_{\\gamma,t},\\quad\\bar{\\chi}_{t}=g_{\\bar \\chi}t+u_{\\bar \\chi,t}$$ We make $g_{\\omega}=g_{\\bar \\gamma}+g_{\\ba","date":"2024-01-19","objectID":"/en/posts/hlt/:2:0","tags":["Literature Review","Stata"],"title":"HLT: Lifecycle and Wage Decomposition","uri":"/en/posts/hlt/"},{"categories":["Economic Study"],"content":"Quantitative decomposition That is to say, the following formula is estimated: $$\\log(w_{ict})=\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+\\sum_{x\\in\\mathbf{X}}\\phi_{x}D_{ict}^{x}+\\gamma_ {t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict}$$ $\\theta(s_{ict})$ represents the income function of educational age, which is generally expressed linearly. $D_{ict}^{x}$ is a dummy variable for each age group in the life cycle. tip Let’s review the knowledge points about dummy variables (dummy) in measurement: Generally, n categories are used to generate n-1 dummy variables to avoid collinearity. That is to say, if there is a period of 5 years, 30 years will be divided into 6 periods, so the period of 0-4 years is generally omitted and 5 dummy variables are generated. The generated coefficients are all conclusions drawn from comparing with the missing parts. In other words, each coefficient is compared to the growth level in the 0-4 years segment. $\\gamma_{t}$: time effect. $\\chi_{c}$ individual effects. Directly use this formula to regression, $D_{ict}^{x}$, $\\gamma_{t}$, $\\chi_{c}$ have collinearity, the Deaton method is to give $\\gamma_{t}$, $\\chi_{c}$ imposes an additional linear constraint. When we set only the queue effect and the time effect to 0, we need to satisfy $\\sum_{t=0}^{T}\\gamma_{t}t=0$.

If you want to see the super-detailed derivation, it is recommended to check out “Disentangling age, cohort and time effects in the additive model” (McKenzie et al., 2006) 6. For the estimated formula: $$ ln(w_{ict})=\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict} $$ Direct regression will have the problem of collinearity - age + year of birth = current year. We cannot directly estimate the form of $\\gamma_t$ and $\\chi_t$ (such as concavity and convexity), but we can use the difference method to study the properties of high-order differences after group subtraction, and then estimate low-order differences. In the life cycle model here, the years of education are linear estimates and easy to decompose, so we ignore 7 for now. The individual number is $i$, and the queue is grouped $c$ according to the life cycle. $k$ is the work experience, which is equal to $t-c$. The corresponding equations for each group of queues are as follows: $$ y_{ct}=\\alpha+\\beta _kx_{ct}+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ct} $$ **Emphasis! In other words, the estimate of $\\color{red}{k}$ of $\\beta_{\\color{red}{k}}$ is closely related to $\\color{blue}{k=t-c}$! ! ! ! We take advantage of this to perform high-order difference estimation. ** We are in the same group (for example, we select the middle-aged group $c_1$), and use the data of $y_{c_1,t_2}$ minus $y_{c_1,t_1}$ to carry out the time analysis within the group. The first difference** of: During the life cycle, the time difference of each group of queues is evenly distributed, basically every five years, that is $$ (x_{ci,t+1}-x_{ci,t})=(x_{cj,t+1}-x_{cj,t})=\\Delta x_t $$ So the formula can be transformed as follows: $$ \\begin{align} \u0026y_{c_1,t_2}-y_{c_1,t_1}\\newline \u0026=(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{1}}})(x_{c_1,t_2}- x_{c_1,t_1})+(\\gamma_{t_2}-\\gamma_{t_1})+(\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_2}-\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_1})\\newline \u0026=(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{1}}})\\Delta x_t+(\\gamma_{t_2}-\\gamma_{t_1})+(\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_2}-\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_1})\\newline \\end{align} $$ The corresponding time relationship $k=t-c$, we then perform the first-order difference in time on another same group. We select a group $c_{0}$ that is younger than group $c_{1}$ (regarded as a youth group), and get $k_2=t_1-c_0,k_3=t_2-c_0$. At this point the first difference is obtained: $$ \\begin{align} \u0026y_{c_0,t_2}-y_{c_0,t_1}\\newline \u0026=(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{3}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}})\\Delta x_t+(\\gamma_{t_1+1}-\\gamma_{t_1})+(\\varepsilon_{c_0,t_2}-\\varepsilon_{c_0,t_1})\\newline \\end{align} $$ At this time, we subtract the first-order differences of $c_1$ and $c_0$ the two sets of time: $$ \\begin{align} \u0026[y_{c_1,t_2}-y_{c_1,t_1}]-[y_{c_0,t_2}-y_{c_0,t_1}]\\newline \u0026=(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{1}}})\\Delta x_t+(\\gamma_{t_1+1}-\\gamma_{t_1})+(\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_2}-\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_1})\\newline \u0026-(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{3}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}})\\Delta x_t-(\\gamma_{t_1+1}-\\gamma_{t_1})-(\\varepsilon_{c_0,t_2}-\\varepsilon_{c_0,t_1})\\newline \u0026=[(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{1}}})-(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{3}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}})]\\Delta x_t-\\Delta_{c}\\Delta_{t}\\varepsilon_{c_{0},t_{2}} \\end{align} $$ We can find that this high-order difference does not contain time effect $\\gamma_t$ and queue effect $\\chi_c$ at this time. $[(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{j}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{j-1}}})-(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{ j+2}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{j}}})]$ also has geom","date":"2024-01-19","objectID":"/en/posts/hlt/:3:1","tags":["Literature Review","Stata"],"title":"HLT: Lifecycle and Wage Decomposition","uri":"/en/posts/hlt/"},{"categories":["Economic Study"],"content":"HLT Full name heckman-lochner-taber. The introduction here mainly refers to the appendix of ““golden ages”: A tale of the labor markets in China and the united states” (Hanming et al., 2023) 8. The original text can be found in “Life cycle wage growth across countries” (Lagakos et al., 2018) The previous equation estimate decomposes the wage contribution into: work experience, cohort, age, and education. This is what leads to collinearity, but this decomposition is not permanent. If we look at people’s wage growth from a life cycle perspective, we can put forward a hypothesis: **When a person is about to retire, he will give up any human capital investment. At this time, the source of his wage growth is only the time effect. **At this time, in the two cohorts, within the same $t$ year period, the wage growth rate of the elderly group is 1%; the growth rate of the youth group is 5%, which means that 1% is contributed by the time effect, and 4% is Queue effect + work experience. Then we can study whether the time effect of each group tends to be consistent in old age by continuously adjusting the income effect.

Is there anything greater than hardship in the world of Cthulhu? Unknowable, unseen, incomprehensible, unstoppable. When the absurd logic descends upon the flesh, the transcendent hardships of the era become like a cold and stern mountain. Mazhe attempted to untangle the ripples of fate, believing that reason was the driving force behind the essence of these murders. But what if the murders originated from chaos and disorder themselves? Thus, the looming behemoth behind the tangle of yarn overwhelmed him, and we were horrified to discover that the error lay in our self-assumption that “life contains no errors beyond reason”; the error lay in our refusal to acknowledge that life indeed harbors a corner of “disorder and chaos”. Why do we criticize Erjiu for not handling internal conflicts well in “In the Heat of the Sun,” but “To Live,” “Brothers,” “My Life as Emperor,” and “The Seventh Day” do not elicit the same backlash? As absurd films, I am inclined to believe that “He bian de cuo wu” surpasses “Yu zhou tan suo bian ji bu” in terms of its thematic depth. Like Erjiu’s ending, the latter also finds solace and inspiration from survivors, empathizing with them as they await the arrival of spring after enduring hardship. Hence, people extol phrases like “the good days are still ahead” and “there is no winter that cannot be crossed,” because we are destined to overcome, and therefore, we face the future without fear. This is evidently a circular argument. But outside of this cycle, who will question the winter? Yu Hua’s works confront the source of suffering directly—a Cthulhu without an object to speak of. Yu zhou tan suo bian ji bu\r“The Mistake by the River”? Where exactly does the mistake lie? On a concrete level, Ma Zhe refuses to acknowledge the randomness of the madman’s killings, thus deviating from the truth from the outset. This exposes the villagers’ reality of not being accepted by society: Ma Zhe does not believe that the madman would commit murder, so he indirectly uncovers the taboo love affairs after poetry creation, the secret cross-dressing after unjust cases, and the perverse motives behind kind adoption. The more Ma Zhe denies madness, the more madness he uncovers. As a police officer, Ma Zhe’s pursuit of truth and adherence to logic seemed unquestionable, yet it led to greater pain and death. Ma Zhe believed in the logic of life, but the reality of this logic crushed him and his world. His clues only led from one person’s madness to another’s. A person who refused to acknowledge the rationality of madness ended up surrounded by it, and eventually succumbed to madness himself. This was the mistake he made. From an abstract perspective, what is madness? It is suffering, akin to good people not receiving their due rewards, efforts not being reciprocated, and people seeking pain amidst happiness. It is the kind-hearted family giving birth to a disabled child. Ma Zhe refused to believe that the madman was the murderer, just as he refused to believe that his own child could become a madman. When Ma Zhe finally accepted the reality that the madman was the culprit, he had to raise his own child, who had become mad. The river is the bond of fate. Xu Liang from the Director’s Cut runs by the river, the old lady dies by the river, the poet-teacher dies by the river, the child dies by the river. They bury their secrets by the riverside. “Madman, murder case, riverside, rain curtain, life” are strung together in a strange, low-probability manner.

Before the advent of the camera, painters pursued realism. Correspondingly, the Romanticism of the Renaissance was a style characterized by exaggerated creativity. Romanticism isn’t just a genre; it’s an impulse! Any work can have a touch of romanticism. With the emergence of the camera, painters began to contemplate the differences between painting and photography. People started to deliberately emphasize rough brushstrokes and “mental tones.” Among them is a unique brushstroke\rMost styles of painting in the modern era are essentially “reconstructions” of the real world, combining brushstrokes with the artist’s understanding of the world’s essence. Futurists: Science can explain everything; it’s a symbol of order. We should use orderly geometric shapes to compose our works and showcase the beauty of rationality. Symbolists: All cognition is a product of society. To stimulate people’s thinking on a topic, we need to transfer the same object to different scenarios. For example, moving a spoon from a table to the ceiling, or replacing actors in a stage play with wooden stakes in an open-air mine. Our inexplicability is precisely to alienate things, thus provoking people’s reflection (classic anthropological alienation). Impressionists: Colors, light, and time are constantly changing. What we paint is just the light atmosphere at a specific moment in time. We need to learn to observe, to observe the changes in color and light of an object under various conditions. (That’s why Monet painted over 300 versions of “Water Lilies”). Pointillists: The colors of light can be expressed by the three primary colors. By letting the three primary colors form dots that overlap and eventually create an image. Collage Art: Reassemble everyday objects to express ideas, and materials such as newspapers and posters can also be reassembled into a new work. Dada Art: Gradually entering the realm of conceptual deconstruction and reflection. All concepts should be deconstructed and reexamined. So, in the eyes of Dadaists, a toilet becomes a fountain, and a clothes hanger becomes an octopus. apple man\rOnce we understand the artists’ principles and backgrounds, previously perplexing images seem to become more understandable. Nowadays, many “performance art” pieces and inexplicable paintings may make people feel that art is just empty boasting. I think, in fact, discussions about painting concepts ultimately lead to abstraction. Just like some branches of mathematics, when taken to certain depths, lose the concept of numbers. Painters abstract concepts and expressions themselves, and then use incomprehensible actions to express themselves. It seems that abstraction through paintings is a trend in the so-called avant-garde. First-class art is intoxicating in appearance, or concise and easy to understand, and the icing on the cake is understanding the connotation. Second-rate art is incomprehensible in appearance, but once you understand the connotation, you can see the light. Third-rate art is boring in appearance and pretends to be sophisticated. I believe that aesthetic appreciation in art is also a process of interaction between knowledge and images. Therefore, interpreting the same painting with the background of the times can lead to different personal perceptions. Perhaps, the reader’s perspective on the appreciation of the work itself becomes an art alongside the era. The main benefit an artist or authority brings is simply that their status allows us to have the patience to think about and try to understand their actions. Therefore, when facing artists, we choose to think rather than blindly follow them.

People yearn for the medieval times much like they long for the idyllic countryside—a utopia that exists solely in the realm of imagination. Strangely enough, there are those who find solace in pursuing a different path, even if it leads them astray—people like myself, who revel in the unconventional. Such individuals find joy in this “quirky” compendium. What I mean to say is, if you’re not the type to delve into “strict history” or merely a gamer seeking entertainment, then perhaps you’re the kind to seek philosophy in games and dark humor in history. Well, congratulations, you’re ready to embark on your journey through the medieval world. This book is not suited for those seeking a detailed understanding of the medieval period. It follows the main theme of “heroic dragon-slaying role-playing,” presenting popular medieval tales and literature in a digestible format. This implies that there’s no obligation to provide a comprehensive educational framework covering the economic, cultural, and political aspects of the era. Unlike traditional history books that offer analytical viewpoints, this book occasionally offers the author’s perspective on the use of historical sources. Are laws reliable? People of that time didn’t necessarily follow them; the focus lies more on exploring the motives behind lawmaking. Are diaries sincere? Many medieval individuals clandestinely recorded their mastery of magic or their various exploits, yet some narratives and their subsequent personal records harbor hidden contradictions. HOW TO SLAY A DRAGON: A Fantasy Hero’s Guide to the Real Middle Ages\rThis book primarily focuses on elucidating the everyday aspects of life during the medieval period: From unicorns to the fantastical creatures of the time, From troubadours to the ballads of the era, From cursed marshes to poorly managed latrines, From courtship to the moral codes of the time. It delves into topics such as medieval bathroom practices, dental hygiene, road systems, inns, and even rustic romance. What captivates the reader is the contrast between the titles and the content, drawing them into the next intriguing chapter. The examples provided by the author are remarkably close to life and imbued with humor. For instance, were there really records of religious miracles and magical occurrences in the medieval period? Indeed, there are documented instances of individuals keeping diaries (in the form of autobiographies) detailing their studies in magic, which were later studied by others—resulting in a profound sense of shame. As for the various daily occurrences in medieval life, the author doesn’t shy away from employing witty and satirical language. Take, for instance, the scenario of the three individuals in a duel, where the one who initially arrived naked ends up surviving—a lesson for all: “In the medieval times, always carry a weapon in secret.” Regarding unclean neighbors, the sentiment is expressed as “Neighbors will be neighbors; they’re not cursed until their excrement blocks the streets, at which point perhaps they do become cursed—curses may be false, but filth is real.” And in the Byzantine Empire, where bizarre tragedies are anything but unusual, nothing seems out of the ordinary. As the author doubles as a narrator and a guide through the adventures of the hero, these humorous remarks infuse the book with a strong sense of interactivity. Moreover, the titles themselves carry a distinct flavor reminiscent of Japanese anime RPGs. While microhistory books like “Soulstealers: The Chinese Sorcery Scare of 1768” and “1587, a Year of No Significance: The Ming Dynasty in Decline” meticulously analyze individual historical records to support overarching themes, this book takes a different approach.

During the boring time of the Chinese New Year holidays, I finally finished reading “The Calling of Spirits.” In 1768, a panic of sorcery called “The Calling of Spirits” swept across the land of the Qing Empire. Surprisingly, the terms “prosperous era” and “sorcery” became parallel concepts. Kong Feili followed the thread of the “sorcery/hair-cutting case” and dissected the entire class structure of the Qing Dynasty—faced with the unheard-of sorcery of hair-cutting, each class had its own interpretation. In summary, the “Calling of Spirits” case involves three main threads: The panic and public dissemination of sorcery among common people. The political concerns and exploitation of the “Calling of Spirits” by the emperor. The bureaucratic dilemma of officials fearing pressure from above and below.

The “Calling of Spirits” case involved an unheard-of form of sorcery where one’s money could be stolen simply by cutting off their braid. For the common people, who believed in the existence of the soul, “calling of spirits” was a widely circulated folk custom, providing a foundation for belief in sorcery. China’s deep-rooted local sentiment made it easier for people to demonize outsiders. At this time, Chinese construction workers and the monk class, due to the transient nature of their professions, were particularly susceptible to suspicion. The expansion of the “Calling of Spirits” incidents originated from these transient populations.

Faced with sorcery, the Qing Dynasty faced inherent cultural contradictions. Despite Emperor Qianlong’s early attempts to distance the “hair-cutting case” from political dissent, the braided queue remained a symbol of Manchu identity. As rulers of the Qing Dynasty, their attitude reflected not only fear of rebellion but also dissatisfaction with the Sinicization of the Manchus. The inherent weakness of feudal dynasties was evident in the legal ambiguity regarding “sorcery.” While the emperor and the state used the concept of “divine right” to bolster their legitimacy, sorcery was seen as both a miracle and a threat. This led to vague laws regarding sorcery in the Qing Dynasty, which had to be established nonetheless.

The bureaucratic system of the Qing Dynasty was rife with inequality.The core of Kong Lifai’s research lies in the impact of this system on information dissemination and policy implementation. The emperor regarded bureaucrats as tools, establishing various channels. Although the ceremonial language was cumbersome, it served both as a means of communication and a way to delineate status. Without the ceremonial aspects, the emperor would struggle to bear the burden of pushing through tasks, yet reverting to formality also led to inefficiency. In the “hair-cutting case,” the most prominent aspect was the prevalence of officials’ evaluations filled with flattery and mutual protection. Under the system of mutual recommendation for official selection, actions at all levels were aligned along an axis of interests. Bureaucratic evaluations manifested as a strip, with flattery revolving around imperial power. Qing officials’ evaluations were brief and crude, with achievements attributed to “events.” What’s terrifying is that officials had the ability to control these events, and the moral risk of self-directed deception occurred easily under the desire for positive imperial evaluations and mutual concealment among peers. From this moment on, imperial evaluations had never had such power to influence the course of events, yet Qianlong’s decisions remained loyal to his position as a Manchu emperor. Was this management by an ethnic minority a political distortion? Regardless, as the “calling souls” case shattered, the actors on the stage retreated one by one.

Faced with the same “soul calling” and hair-cutting incidents, the experiences of different social classes are completely different. Kong Feili has conducted a perfect “heterogeneity” analysis and class analysis of society. It is worth noting that this result is a structured classification rather than a combination of multiple quantities. Therefore, I believe that the discussion of “The Soul Calling” should be separated from “The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind”. The “Soul Calling” case has many similarities with the characteristics of the Qing Dynasty. This is an explanation of the decline and turning point under the prosperous age, and it is also the inevitable result of the historical operation of the feudal dynasty. Although the case seems to revolve around the emperor’s attitude, the emperor remains faithful to his class. However, China at this time had not yet achieved harmonious integration of its diverse cultural groups, leading to distortions in the operation of power. How could absurd sorcery emerge in a “prosperous age”? Perhaps coincidence is just a turning point in history. The big fish lurking beneath the surface of the water has never stopped swimming, just casting fleeting shadows in the rise and fall of governance. But we must be vigilant, for history occasionally drops insane fuses. Once the elements are in place—there is nothing to stand in the way of this madness.

Excessive drinking is always harmful to health. Here are some personal insights based on my experiences. The banquets I encountered in several counties generally followed four stages: Stage One: Personal introductions, after which individuals start drinking voluntarily. Stage Two: Mutual exchanges and inviting others to drink, one-on-one. Stage Three: Speech by leaders, giving collective advice, followed by a group toast where everyone stands and toasts around the table. Stage Four: As the banquet wraps up, exchanging WeChat contacts. Strategies for drinking should be flexible and adapted according to each stage. Spell casting preparation: Emphasize repeatedly that you don’t drink, haven’t drunk before, to reduce the difficulty level as much as possible. Stage One: Usually, when standing up to introduce yourself, you can start pouring a bit of the drink from the small or medium-sized glass. Alternatively, you can discreetly pour it out under the table beforehand. When raising the glass, use your hand to cover the side of the glass (fully covering the glass would look too fake!), so that others can’t see the level of the drink, thinking it’s in the pouring state. Stage Two: Because it’s a university student survey, you can eat and drink casually without knowing the rules. Pay attention to see if there’s milk or tea cups on the table. Drink water to one-third full, hold the wine in your mouth after the toast (be careful not to puff your mouth up! Tongue might be quite rough), pretend to drink the beverage, and spill the wine into the beverage. If no beverage is available, the filled bowl of rice or soup is the best hiding tool When others interject to add to the conversation, it’s also a good opportunity for a small move. Typically, at a drinking session, everyone usually watches the person speaking. Stage three: At this point, the meal is almost over and most people are at least tipsy, so they can rest assured. When toasting, cover the sides of the glass with your hands. Join the toasting group and pretend to be drinking, but no wine enters your mouth. Move around a lot. At this time, everyone is usually trying to please others and will usually not notice small movements. It is recommended to use the teachings in Liu Qian’s magic class - big movements cover up small movements to mislead the other party’s attention. For example, one hand makes movements to attract attention, and the other hand gently pours wine on the ground.

The Tourism Bureau has granted the Forbidden City the highest rating and naturally desires to do the same for Dunhuang. However, the Mogao Grottoes have not acquiesced. In former days, the Taoist king had already cast out all the gold, and the resplendent treasures rode makeshift cattle carts, wandering into foreign lands. The sedimented history pays no heed to transient hustle and bustle, while the British Museum, destined for daily foot traffic, bustles incessantly. History chuckles. Faced with vast, magnificent toys, infants find themselves bewildered. Yet, the entirety of culpability does not solely rest upon the Taoist king—Dunhuang was not unearthed in an auspicious era, and even today, I cannot easily sketch the contours of ancients. Thus, here, cultural heritage preservation and dissemination intertwine. To behold Dunhuang is to encounter Dunhuang yet not entirely Dunhuang. This journey has also lifted the veil of mystery in my mind. The image of Dunhuang, akin to the temples of the Maya, has dissolved. The Mogao Grottoes are neither a testament to the grandeur of a mysterious dynasty nor a site of blessings for unknown merchants. The “donors” are part of the Mogao Grottoes culture. In other words—who carved which caves. Everything is recorded plainly! After all, without leaving names, how would the deities receive their “payments”? Dunhuang lacks the unsolved mysteries of the Maya, but conversely, beneath the Maya civilization, there is no deeply sedimented loess land. The establishment of the grottoes spans from the Southern and Northern Dynasties to the Yuan Dynasty, and the marginal expansion of its scale reflects the prosperity and decline of the Silk Road. From the Li family of the Tang Dynasty to nameless merchants, if you dare to dig, you can dig. There are thousands of caves, each unique. Setting aside wealth, these grottoes embrace the “donors” who come and go, regardless of status, place of origin, or time. Relying solely on “flying apsaras” cannot uphold the phrase “Chinese treasure.” The most precious aspect of Dunhuang lies in the flowing years and its unique cultural temperament. History flows over these precipitous cliffs, time flips upside down, and finally condenses at the depths of the caves. From the tiles of the Southern and Northern Dynasties to the Yuan Dynasty, patterns evolve from simple geometric shapes to rounded lotuses. Whether angry or smiling, sharp or gentle, the myriad heavenly deities and Buddhas respond to the times. The multitude of cave entrances symbolizes the interaction of communities. In the long river of history filled with wars, there indeed exists such a solid port of ethnic integration. Inside the caves, there is no strong light; instead, the mineral pigments from the Tang Dynasty cover every surface, creating a faint fluorescent effect. Most of the sculptures I observed were of figures like Shakyamuni Buddha and Guanyin. Simply speaking of the sculptures, I did not perceive any advanced craftsmanship or exquisite expressions. According to the introduction, the internal craftsmanship mainly involves unique filling methods, often utilizing local materials, with a deeper cultural significance such as the reclining Buddha in Nirvana. Observing the seated Buddha indoors is quite marvelous. Unlike viewing the Leshan Giant Buddha under the bright sunlight, leaving nothing unseen, looking up at the seated Buddha inside the cave is different. The shadows above exude a profound sense of emptiness, making the Buddha statue appear enigmatic and compelling one to kneel in reverence. The murals of Dunhuang, illuminated by the dim light within the caves, leave one spellbound.

The Qilian Mountains, with their majestic peaks and ridges, reveal the lean loess skin weathered over ages, adorned with streaks of black and red hues. The mountain summits swell like vertebrae, encircling the narrow passage with a slow, imposing embrace. Today, it serves as a natural pastureland, but yesterday, it was a treacherous gorge. Traveling along the main road, the distant mountains loom, pressed into ink wash, with shades of ochre and cyan dominating the scene. Once vegetation is lost and the mountains no longer provide cover, the vast sky and embracing Gobi become desolate. In this land of beacon fires and billowing smoke, tufts of grass resemble slender arrows, rudely piercing the desert’s skin at inopportune moments. In the valleys adorned with shrubs, occasional glimpses of the gentle ruins of the Great Wall emerge, nearly worn away by wind and sand, resembling mere road markers. Occasionally, a herd of horses, a group of cattle, or a few windmills appear, only to vanish behind the car window in the blink of an eye. If Don Quixote were to behold the slender white windmill blades at the foot of the mountain, he might indeed be astonished to encounter such elegantly slender giants, wouldn’t he? Yet, who created these giants? Who nurtured the creatures in the desert? The sands of history have never ceased to erode and bury, yet some have ventured far from the encroaching desert. There are always camel bells ringing in the dryness, and the aging loess also boasts the merit of blocking the billowing smoke. Initially, no one paid attention to the flowers aging beneath the cliffs, until the monuments of history stood tall above the sands of time. The distant sands carry no echoes, but who traversed the Hexi Corridor?
