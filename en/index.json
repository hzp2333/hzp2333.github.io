[{"categories":["Economics Study"],"content":"The Question of Institutions vs. Geography In the long course of economic development, the nation-state appears to be an inevitable formation, but why must it be a nation? Why are there such vast disparities between nations? This is a critical question. Fascinating elements abound in national development—such as the Mafia123, natural resource endowments, foreign trade, natural disasters4, and power rivalries5… Yet for the most part these can be distilled into innate geographical endowments and acquired cultural-institutional evolution. Much like how we no longer debate whether liberalism or Keynesianism is superior, but instead clarify their respective policy boundaries. Resource endowments and cultural-institutional factors invariably influence each other; the critical question lies in which factor influenced the other first. For instance, the seminal paper on rice in the south and wheat in the north6: Rice cultivation requires collective collaboration; wheat farming favors individual labor. The difference in planting structures created cultural divides between north and south. Geographic discontinuities, to some extent, can mitigate the endogeneity of the mutual influence between geography, culture, and institutions—just as Daron illustrated in “Why Nations Fail” through examples of the United States and Mexico7; South Korea and North Korea; and East and West Germany. Now the crucial question is: Through what characteristics do cultural institutions bring about such tremendous disparities in development? “Political hierarchy and regional economic development: Evidence from a spatial discontinuity in China” utilizes the geographic discontinuity created when Chongqing was elevated from a prefecture-level city in Sichuan Province to a municipality directly under the central government in 1997 to investigate the phenomenon that empowering local governments through increased political hierarchy can promote regional development.

In 1997, Chongqing was elevated from a prefecture-level city in Sichuan Province to a municipality directly under the central government. The expansion of decision-making power brought by this change manifests as: Increased administrative, personnel, and fiscal decision-making powers. More surplus in fiscal allocation. Can promoting administrative rank drive development? The core mechanism by which administrative power stimulates economic growth is informational advantage + power coordination. However, there is a contradiction between decentralization and local fragmentation. The problem with decentralizing to all cities is local fragmentation and the consequences of corruption, so the dilemma of overall governance is always how to balance decentralization to allow localities to fully leverage informational advantages with centralization to weaken local protectionism, rent-seeking, and corruption—government power structure and economic growth. Diagram\rIn terms of power allocation, the paper’s theory and the points to explore can be divided into the following parts: Core Question: Does the allocation of power structure affect economic growth? For example, converting counties to districts When local government in South Africa is very decentralized, existing studies show weak effects9. The Tradeoff Dilemma: The decentralization and diffusion of political power bring benefits of flexible decision-making, but also bring local protectionism, corruption, and rent-seeking. Impact: Do these behaviors represent spontaneous order? Public choice theory reveals that politicians are motivated by the desire to expand their power networks rather than maximizing social welfare. Marginal Contribution: Methodologically using geographic discontinuities to discuss government power diffusion and decentralization. Sichuan and Chongqing share very similar geographic, cultural environments, and ethnic composition. Compared to South Africa, China’s power decentralization involves substantive enhancement; the appointment system from higher levels can better prevent corruption.

Political Agency Problems Local voters likewise possess informational advantages and can monitor localities more effectively; Promotes mutual competition among localities; In regions receiving less oversight, local elites may more easily collude to foster corruption. Countermeasures: Sufficient electoral competition, transparency of budgetary procedures, voter awareness, media supervision, and reward-punishment mechanisms. Following status elevation, Chongqing gained: expanded personnel, fiscal decision-making, and construction planning powers better tailored to local conditions; greater fiscal resources (rendering investment more attractive).

So the question is, how to make TexStudio achieve the same functionality? The answer is custom macros. TexStudio supports custom macro definitions. For detailed syntax, refer to the official documentation Personal macros. Normal mode macros can be understood as text transformation and completion. I write ￥￥￥￥ in the trigger (note: intentionally leaving a space at the end). %| represents the cursor position after completion. Personal macros can also have custom shortcuts. For example, in the image below, I set Ctrl+M as the shortcut for inserting $$. When I type ￥*2 (space), it will also automatically trigger the transformation. Triggers are format detection that automatically activate when regular expressions match\rPersonal macros also support script sequences. If you know how to use them, you can create various tricks (like chained transformations). Therefore, when writing macros, pay attention to the order—place macros with stricter regular expression checks above. For example, ￥￥￥￥ to $$$$ should be placed before ￥￥ to $$. Environment mode feels quite redundant and can be completely replaced by normal mode. Script mode is more flexible and supports the JavaScript language. I wrote one that can transform content in the format -content1-content2-content2 (tab key) into code: \\begin{content1}[content2]\\label{content2} \\end{content1} I also further set up a mapping: if content1 is “证明”, it transforms to “proof”; if it’s “概念”, it transforms to “definition”. The code is as follows: // ===== Chinese-English environment mapping ===== var envMap = { \"定理\": \"theorem\", \"引理\": \"lemma\", \"命题\": \"proposition\", \"性质\": \"proposition\", \"练习\": \"exercise\", \"思考题\": \"exercise\", \"思考\": \"exercise\", \"问题\": \"exercise\", \"推论\": \"corollary\", \"定义\": \"definition\", \"概念\": \"definition\", \"例子\": \"example\", \"备注\": \"remark\", \"注意\": \"remark\", \"笔记\": \"note\", \"注释\": \"note\", \"案例\": \"case\", \"证明\": \"proof\", \"证\": \"proof\", \"练习\": \"exercise\" }; // ===== Get matched content ===== var env = triggerMatches[1]; // environment var title = triggerMatches[2]; // title var label = triggerMatches[3]; // label // ===== Convert Chinese environment to LaTeX English environment ===== if (envMap[env]) { env = envMap[env]; } // ===== Construct LaTeX code ===== var txt = \"\\\\begin{\" + env + \"}\"; if (title) txt += \"[\" + title + \"]\"; if (label) txt += \"\\\\label{\" + label + \"}\"; txt += \"\\n\\n\\\\end{\" + env + \"}\\n\"; // ===== Insert text ===== cursor.insertText(txt); // ===== Adjust cursor position inside the environment ===== cursor.movePosition(2, cursorEnums.Up); cursor.movePosition(1, cursorEnums.StartOfLine); The trigger is set as: \\-(.+)\\-(.+)\\-(.+)\\t *\\t is the tab key *(.+) : Parentheses represent an environment, representing the content between separators -. Where .+ represents one or more characters. If at least two characters are required, use .+. instead. The logic isn’t difficult either. The three parentheses in the trigger’s regular expression correspond to env, title, and label in the code. Fill them into the code template, then move the cursor.

For example, the value of subsequent posts on Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), WeChat Moments, and group “screen resonance.” At this point, the demand function becomes: $$ D=\\sum d^{\\prime}(p,D)=F(p,D),\\quad F_p\u003c0,F_d\u003e0 $$ Recursive structure—total market demand D is the sum of individual demands d, while each individual’s demand function considers total market demand D. The total market demand function still shows less demand at higher prices ($F_p\u003c0$). The market also has a positive feedback structure: the more people buy, the more are attracted ($F_D\u003e0$) (network effect). Next, we differentiate the total demand function: $$L(p,D)=F(p,D)-D=0$$ $$ dL=L_pdp+L_DdD=0 $$ At this point, $$ L_p=F_p,\\quad L_D=F_D-1 $$ Finally, we obtain: $$ F_pdp+(F_D-1)dD=0 $$ Transforming, we get the rate of price change with respect to demand6: $$ \\frac{dp}{dD}=G_D=\\frac{1-F_D}{F_p} $$ Here, $G_d$ represents the derivative of the inverse demand function with respect to demand d.

Until the firm reaches the third-stage inflection point of production $p_{max}$ (compatible with traditional explanation, which is Figure 3’s content). But now, based on the network model, there’s a new possibility— When total demand is low, $F_D\u003c1$; when total demand is high, $F_D\u003e1$. At this point, the total social demand function is no longer a monotonically declining line but a curve that first declines then rises. Figure 4\rMR Curve in Figure 4 Assuming fixed costs, $$ \\begin{aligned} MR\u0026=\\frac{d(PD-C)}{dD}\\\\ \u0026=P+D\\frac{dP}{dD}\\\\ \u0026=P+D(\\frac{1-F_D}{F_p}) \\end{aligned} $$ Since in the low-demand stage $\\frac{dp}{dD}=G_D=\\frac{1-F_D}{F_p}\u003c0$, this results in a downward-sloping curve. Actually, the height and slope of the MR curve relative to the D(P) demand curve can be compared as follows: Height (evident from the MR equation): $$ MR-D(P)=D(\\frac{1-F_D}{F_p}) $$ Therefore, initially the MR curve lies below the demand curve. This represents the multiple equilibria in reality! For example, pricing at $p^*$. If the product becomes an instant hit, with word-of-mouth spreading, then market demand accumulates to the $D_g^*$ level. If the product receives little attention, actual demand remains at the $D_b^*$ level. Given this uncertainty, firms generally dislike overproduction ($s-D_b^*$). Therefore, firms tend to choose the equilibrium level where $MR=0$. Significance of the Model This model explains why advertising and marketing are so important in real-world store experience (this is natural). The least obvious point is—why viral firms maintain conservative pricing during hot sales periods. The essence lies in uncertainty brought by network effects. The model elegantly depicts why equilibrium during the popular phase is so brief—price function adjustment space is limited—when network effects continue to weaken, prices automatically decline. Currently, there remains exploration space for variables characterizing network effects. Stepping Back to Understand Network Effects Individual utility is: $$ U_i=U(x_i,y_i;X) $$ where $X=\\sum x_{j}$ represents network effects. Next, we solve for marginal conditions: $$ MU_{x_i}=\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x_i}+\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial X}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x_i} $$ If $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial X}$ is large, it signifies a positive externality: when consumers purchase viral products, the additional satisfaction from social attributes may even exceed the negative utility from price increases.

Expanding from Network Effects Great principles never use narrow concepts. Regional economics, spatial autocorrelation is also a type of network effect. Distance and orientation in regional economics have never been “narrow”—cultural distance (e.g., dialect regions), economic distance (industrial structure), cognitive distance (e.g., industrial structure competition or complementarity, patent similarity)……… Just like the multiplier effect in Keynesian theory. Actually, Keynes also had the concept of multiple equilibria. An economy, under certain conditions, may have multiple equilibria. Screenshot from Williamson’s “Macroeconomics”\rDue to incomplete adjustment of interest rates, prices, and wages, society has a self-reinforcing effect. People’s sentiments alternate between optimism and pessimism and infect each other, which is what Keynes called “animal spirits.” Precisely because of this, adjustment of social expectations and regulation of economic signals are so important. This is why Keynes7 said: “In the short run, people’s psychological expectations and confidence (animal spirits) are more important than gold reserves.” Economics today has moved toward complexity economics. Complexity economists emphasize network effects, heterogeneous agents, multiple equilibria in society. Actually, the explanation of network effects is also simple: I follow the rise and fall of social voices, but how to extract social voices and incorporate them into analysis? This is one of the most worthwhile issues to explore.

From a practical perspective, monopoly is generally categorized into the following types: Natural Monopoly: Monopoly caused by cost subadditivity, specifically meaning “the phenomenon where a single enterprise engaging in large-scale production and operation is more efficient (with lower average unit costs) than multiple enterprises operating simultaneously.” Its characteristics often manifest as resource scarcity or economies of scale. For example, a company reduces production costs by incorporating upstream and downstream manufacturers or acquiring relevant scarce resources as subsidiaries. A contemporary example: Platform economies exhibit characteristics of natural monopoly—costs consist of substantial fixed costs (infrastructure) and minimal marginal costs (increased platform service volume). When a platform has invested sufficiently in infrastructure, it has strong incentives to expand its service scale, ultimately reducing average costs. This is why industries prone to natural monopoly, such as electricity, gas, telephone services, and long-distance transportation, are often state-controlled or price-regulated. This is why Coase contemplated that the origin of firms might stem from transaction costs—achieving transactions requires additional costs, and corporate entities help reduce transaction costs. Natural monopoly reduces average costs through corporate expansion. Administrative Monopoly: The government grants an enterprise exclusive rights to produce certain products or services. Resource Monopoly: Key resources are owned by a single enterprise. An Interesting Historical Story There was a popular childhood game—Monopoly (English: Monopoly, literally translated as “monopoly”). Players roll dice to buy and sell properties on a map to earn money. The game’s original intention was to demonstrate the harms of monopoly.

Enterprises, centered on profit maximization, seek monopoly and achieve collusion, offering another angle to comprehend market operations. Monopoly is a profound subject without a specific, unified framework. Contemporary times still allow for new explanations and models of monopoly causes or more unified understanding frameworks. Cost Subadditivity: Cost subadditivity may result from technology or economies of scale. Resource Control: Special core resources, not limited to natural resources. For example, in contemporary times, Tencent’s social software possesses vast social user resources. The social nature of Honor of Kings relies on social software resources (most people play while complaining); premium liquor brands like Moutai hold bargaining power over downstream markets. Administrative Reasons: Government policies, such as price controls and business licensing systems. Corporate Collusion: When conducting research, consider interactions among multiple causes. For instance, government policies may induce corporate collusion. Nobel laureate Tirole’s significant contribution was deeply introducing game theory to analyze market competition, developing industrial organization theory. Historical Reasons: For example, a company simply established industry standards favorable to itself first. Although the concept of first-mover economy was only recently proposed by the central government, it can be understood as historical contingency or an extension of first-mover advantage. Diamond brands are typical examples—not just marketing, but the first diamond company shaped the diamond industry’s operation.

Pricing above marginal cost and output below the level corresponding to social welfare maximization are considered inefficient.

This U-shaped equilibrium frequently appears in markets. What degree of monopoly promotes innovation? At the patent level, the duration of patent protection, patent application fees, and principles of patent protection remain topics worthy of discussion. Additionally, firms in perfectly competitive markets lack pricing power—price is an exogenous variable. Monopoly markets grant firms some pricing power, often leading to discussions about price discrimination. Although “price discrimination” carries negative connotations in Chinese, in economic concepts, it is a pricing strategy. In some cases, if price discrimination effectively expands transaction volume, social welfare may increase.

The earliest antitrust law in the United States was the Sherman Antitrust Act. China’s first antitrust case was the 2008 Coca-Cola Acquisition of Huiyuan Incident. Domestic private enterprise Huiyuan wanted to sell the company to Coca-Cola. Public opinion tended to oppose selling domestic enterprises abroad. International opinion suggested that preventing Coca-Cola’s acquisition of Huiyuan reflected overly stringent market behavior regulation in China. How to Define Monopoly and Antitrust When should we prevent corporate mergers? When should we consider a company to hold a monopoly position? Must companies in monopoly positions always be targeted? Ultimately, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation ruled it involved monopoly. After the transaction failed, Huiyuan Juice’s stock price plummeted, and the company’s operational conditions continued deteriorating. Regarding this case, Chinese economist Lang Xianping believed Coca-Cola lost because it was too arrogant.

In 2009, the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China issued Announcement No. 22 of 2019 regarding the Coca-Cola acquisition of Huiyuan case: After the concentration, Coca-Cola Company would have the ability to extend its dominant position in the carbonated soft drink market to the juice beverage market, producing exclusionary and restrictive competitive effects on existing juice beverage enterprises, thereby harming the legitimate rights and interests of beverage consumers. Brand is a key factor affecting effective competition in the beverage market. After the concentration, Coca-Cola Company, by controlling the two well-known juice brands “Minute Maid” and “Huiyuan,” would significantly enhance its control over the juice market. Combined with its existing dominant position in the carbonated beverage market and corresponding transmission effects, the concentration would significantly raise barriers for potential competitors to enter the juice beverage market. The concentration squeezes the survival space of domestic small and medium-sized juice enterprises, inhibits domestic enterprises’ ability to participate in competition and engage in independent innovation in the juice beverage market, adversely affects the effective competitive landscape of China’s juice beverage market, and is detrimental to the sustainable and healthy development of China’s juice industry. The core idea reflected here is: “Antitrust opposes monopoly behavior, not monopoly position.” From the perspective of basic economic knowledge, we have two angles to judge whether an enterprise is a monopoly. Market Share. If a company becomes a behemoth in the market, we can consider it a monopoly. Monopoly Behavior. Our concern is that when a company’s share is sufficiently large, it may cause harm to other enterprises or consumers. The worry is not the monopoly position itself, but the monopoly behavior that may arise in the future. But how large must a company’s market share be to constitute a monopoly? For example, the 2001 United States United States v. Microsoft Corp. case determined Microsoft engaged in market monopoly based on its operating system promoting the Internet Explorer browser, which won the browser wars. Microsoft’s defense was that Internet Explorer was a feature of the operating system, not a separate product. Ultimately, Microsoft was still found guilty of monopoly, though the federal government and Microsoft reached some compromises. Viewing Internet Explorer as an additional feature of the operating system, Microsoft’s operating system market share did not constitute monopoly. This also explains why Microsoft at that time had not yet developed strong bargaining power. Market share is a difficult variable to calculate. China defined both Coca-Cola and Huiyuan Juice as “carbonated soft drinks” to calculate market share. There are other examples in China, such as Moutai and Wuliangye. Article 14 of the Antimonopoly Law explicitly prohibits business operators and trading counterparts from “reaching agreements that restrict the minimum price for resale to third parties.” The evidence that Wuliangye and Moutai constituted monopoly was: Wuliangye and Moutai issued marketing supervision and handling notices stating: A very small number of Wuliangye brand operators and Wuliangye specialty stores acted willfully, disregarding rules, ignoring the overall situation, and lacking broad perspective, engaging in low-price, cross-regional, cross-channel improper sales of Wuliangye. From the perspective of Moutai and Wuliangye, they were engaged in normal price negotiations as manufacturers with downstream distributors, combining their production costs for pricing. Other distilleries also had their own stipulated prices, representing normal market competition behavior. http://politics.people.com.cn/n/2013/0219/c70731-20531032.html\rIn this case, China defined Moutai and Wuliangye as “premium liquor brands” to c","date":"2025-05-01","objectID":"/en/posts/fld/:2:1","tags":["Industrial Economics","Economic Law"],"title":"What Are We Really Opposing When We Fight Monopoly?","uri":"/en/posts/fld/"},{"categories":["Economic Study"],"content":"Defects of Market Share as a Monopoly Standard As seen from the above cases, using market share as a monopoly standard results in varying market shares depending on conceptual definitions, making unified standards difficult. Two Nobel laureates, Friedman and Krugman, explicitly opposed the Microsoft monopoly case, viewing it as government interference harming market freedom. The corresponding theoretical basis is a Chicago School concept—\"Contestable Market.\" Assume a market with only one firm holding 100% market share, but market barriers are low, allowing other firms to enter and exit the market at low cost. In such cases, antitrust action is unnecessary. Similarly, if a firm achieved its position solely through normal technological progress and does not directly hinder other firms’ technological advancement through its position, such monopoly position need not be opposed. Such environments might have been rare historically, but in today’s highly developed digital economy, such cases are not difficult to find. For example, although Tencent occupies the vast majority of the social software market, due to low barriers in the internet social software market, antitrust action is unnecessary. This also explains why JD.com challenged Meituan this year—for JD.com, combining its own logistics fixed capital investments with reliance on platform economies results in relatively low market entry barriers. However, the contestable market theory also has drawbacks. For instance, firms might first use below-cost pricing to capture market share, then raise prices. Lei Jun once criticized his subordinates, saying what he wanted was not profit but market share. This strategy involves using low prices to capture the market first, then gaining dominance, which is why international trade opposes dumping. Another example: Due to geographical factors, Shanxi people favor Fenjiu liquor. Should such substantial market share be subject to antitrust action?

Before 2008, China had no antitrust law, relying only on anti-unfair competition and consumer rights protection for relevant enforcement. Anti-Monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China (2022 Amendment) Article 1: This Law is enacted to prevent and restrain monopoly conduct, protect fair market competition, encourage innovation, improve economic operational efficiency, safeguard consumer interests and social public interests, and promote the healthy development of the socialist market economy. The relationship between monopoly and innovation follows an inverted U-shape. The 2022 amendment added “encourage innovation” as an objective in the general provisions. Article 1 also clearly states that antitrust opposes monopoly behavior, not position. Article 3: Monopoly conduct as referred to in this Law includes: (1) Monopoly agreements reached between business operators; (2) Abuse of dominant market position by business operators; (3) Concentrations of business operators that have or may have effect of eliminating or restricting competition. The concept of concentration of business operators is thought-provoking, also involving the qualitative direction of industrial chains. Article 6: Business operators may, through fair competition and voluntary association, implement concentration according to law, expand business scale, and enhance market competitiveness. Article 7: Business operators with dominant market positions shall not abuse such positions to eliminate or restrict competition. Clarifies that antitrust opposes monopoly behavior, not position. At least monopoly positions driven by innovative technology are not problematic. Subsequent provisions also allow exemptions for reasons involving foreign trade, crisis rescue, and social responsibility. Article 8: For industries where the state-owned economy holds a controlling position and are related to national economic lifelines and national security, as well as industries legally subject to exclusive operation and monopoly sales, the state protects the lawful business activities of their operators, and exercises supervision and regulation over their business conduct and the prices of their commodities and services according to law, safeguarding consumer interests and promoting technological progress. State-monopolized industries possess special characteristics. Article 9: Business operators shall not use data and algorithms, technology, capital advantages, platform rules, etc., to engage in monopoly conduct prohibited by this Law. Special background of the digital economy era. Article 24: Under any of the following circumstances, a business operator may be presumed to have a dominant market position: (1) The market share of one business operator in the relevant market reaches one-half; (2) The combined market share of two business operators in the relevant market reaches two-thirds; (3) The combined market share of three business operators in the relevant market reaches three-fourths. Quantitative standards for monopoly position. The Coca-Cola and Huiyuan acquisition case standards relate to this.

Concentration of business operators. Subsequent provisions also exclude equity situations and subsidiary-related companies.

In a nutshell—we oppose monopoly behavior, not monopoly position. Only when an entity possesses market power, holds a dominant position, and abuses that dominant position to interfere with the market does monopoly occur. We have long grown accustomed to the sins of monopoly, but how large must market share be to be considered large? What hidden distortions might policies bring? In reality, antitrust still has much space for exploration. Monopoly resembles a cycle of dragon slayers becoming dragons themselves—historical cycles seem unavoidable.

Presiding Judge: The state vigorously advocates for the integration of socialist core values and excellent traditional Chinese culture into social life. The trial of this case demonstrates the clear stance and firm position of the People’s Court in lawfully protecting women’s rights and interests and punishing criminal acts. From the perspective of supporters and the presiding judge, the controversy is whether non-consensual sexual conduct after engagement constitutes a violation. In this context, classifying it as illegal is unequivocal. The spirit of the law provides ex ante constraints on our behavior. What should be done, what should not be done, and how society can develop better—all these are reflected in the forward-looking moral concepts emphasized in social sciences2. The constraint here is that regardless of engagement status, marital status, or relationship dynamics, we should maintain sufficient respect toward our partners. However, from the current judicial system, the law has not truly implemented genuine judicial fairness in such cases. In terms of terminology, male rape cases are not adequately considered. Rape violates human rights, not merely women’s rights. Without this principle, what is primarily protected is “objectified chastity”3. The judicial terminology used here is “violation of women’s will,” but rape should not be limited by gender. This linguistic limitation creates the first controversy, diverting the discussion to the issue of betrothal gifts.

Court second trial reversal rate is extremely low, which defies judicial norms Source: Caixin News\rConsidering the particular nature of rape cases4, their adjudication differs from other types of cases: Physical evidence over testimonial evidence? Presumption of innocence? Regarding Procedural Justice Regarding procedural justice, I recall a personal experience that illustrates these tensions. During comprehensive evaluations, competition participation scores and award scores were calculated separately, with upper limits established for both categories. When my award scores reached the maximum allowable limit, I sought to transfer one award point to a participation point. The class committee, however, ruled against this transfer, insisting that I provide formal documentation of participation (the school issued separate certificates for both participation and awards). The complication arose because my proof of participation had been misplaced, leading the committee to conclude that the award certificate could not procedurally validate my participation! 😅 This experience frequently comes to mind when I observe distortions in execution processes. It demonstrates that equilibrium exists across multiple dimensions: flexibility, precision, and cost-efficiency. The judicial system often faces the challenge of making necessary compromises among these competing elements. The most troublesome aspect of such cases—protecting procedural justice is highly susceptible to distortion. The discretionary space regarding when testimonial evidence outweighs physical evidence is enormous. The opposition expresses concern about moral hazards arising ex post, which should be understood as information asymmetry5. Given the elevated importance of testimonial evidence during judicial execution, the cost-benefit calculus for attempting to frame male defendants in such cases becomes fundamentally imbalanced. In particular, these cases involve significant information asymmetry: What evidence can prove women’s consent? This is already extremely difficult. It should be noted that in this case, there was a complete evidence chain. As we know, economics papers are constantly criticized for endogeneity in causal inference. But if we need to establish a unified standard? How much evidence is required to prove something? We may never know.\rPost-fact moral hazard refers to: Will women’s mentality change after learning about this type of adjudication? This moral hazard is also difficult to guarantee.

Synthesizing these perspectives, the answer becomes clear—if rape cases are classified solely as violations of women’s rights rather than fundamental human rights violations, while the judicial spirit may appear correct on the surface, the practical effect of judicial execution becomes problematic. In such framework, the system tends to protect objectified notions of chastity rather than genuinely safeguard women’s rights. This context naturally leads to the overvaluation of testimonial evidence credibility while simultaneously increasing moral hazards, thereby creating position-based conflicts of interest. Prospect Theory; Why Cancer Insurance Rates Are So High Why do people tend to purchase cancer insurance with extremely low incidence rates? Because people tend to imagine what would happen if they had cancer. That is, they always use the outcome of having cancer as their reference point. As for how much evidence is required to convince someone of a crime? At least in this case, it involves prospect theory6—women worry about being violated in the future, while men worry about being falsely accused. For female respondents, the evocative nature of the case generates higher empathy levels, and the available evidence proves sufficient to convince them of the shared experiential reality. Their cognitive reference point typically centers on “what would happen if I were in the same situation” (adverse selection). In contrast, male respondents exhibit greater concern about “what is the risk of being falsely accused” (moral hazard). Historically, verdicts in male rape cases have been disproportionately influenced by cultural values. However, as societal openness and legal consciousness continue to evolve, this concern should diminish in significance. In this particular case, additional corroborating evidence exists, and I maintain considerable confidence in China’s public security and judicial institutions. It is worth noting that the defendant in this case did, in fact, admit to the criminal acts in question. Despite the controversies inherent in such cases, the process of debate and legal discourse remains essential. As the philosophical adage suggests, truth often emerges through the dialectical process of uncertainty, and these arguments enable us to address each case on its individual merits while advancing our collective understanding of justice.

The Selfish Gene inspired the author to understand economic history from an evolutionary perspective, while The Three-Body Problem inspired the search for counterfactuals through science fiction and modeling. Both share the commonality of employing game theory and evolutionary theory. I find Zhao Dingxin’s “Zhao Dingxin | Structural Mechanism Explanation and the Development of Structural Mechanism Relationships After the Big Bang” provides an excellent summary of Malthus’s limitations: The Malthusian equation describes the exponential relationship between individual reproduction rates and population growth in biological populations. However, this equation only holds as a fixed causal relationship under conditions of unlimited food, no intra- or inter-species competition, no predators, no density-dependent diseases, and no migration. The Origin of Wealth improves upon Malthus’s theorem precisely from the perspective of intra- and inter-species competition. Within the framework of selection mechanisms, technological explosions and wealth growth inflection points, as well as the cyclical prosperity and collapse throughout history, find a comprehensive explanation. Challenging mainstream academic views is undoubtedly a difficult process. Beyond discussing theoretical models, this book contains reflections on scientific concepts and methodological points. I have always believed that—top-tier social scientists are selling worldviews. The Origin of Wealth reaches this level of sophistication, integrating evolutionary theory, economic phenomena, and historical context to construct a historical perspective. As the author is fond of science fiction and popular science works on natural sciences, this book is also written with great flair and engagement. Similar to The Selfish Gene, this book resembles more of a handbook for bio-economic modeling. The author introduces the wrong turns he has taken and the process of constructing the paper’s logic. It demonstrates both the courage to challenge mainstream views and rigorous logical systems and academic training—truly a model for our generation.

This book employs a two-sector analysis, where individuals allocate resources between luxury goods and subsistence goods. The Malthusian population equilibrium line further constrains this allocation. The added equilibrium is: equilibrium returns to the population equilibrium line. When population growth exceeds this line, per capita resources decline, manifested as proportional shrinkage of the production possibility curve. The following diagram illustrates one scenario analysis: When societal preference shifts toward luxury goods (indifference curves flatten). Equilibrium falls below the population equilibrium line (production possibility frontier expands). A new equilibrium emerges. This theorem yields a counterintuitive economic insight: As social preferences shift toward luxury goods, social welfare paradoxically increases! The trade-off is temporary deviation from the population equilibrium line during transition. As shown\rI find this two-sector refinement particularly elegant. Its conclusions resonate with historical patterns—as civilizations advance, artistic, aesthetic, and spiritual pursuits increasingly constitute luxury goods. Indeed, humanity’s valuation of goods transcending mere survival has steadily intensified. Paradoxically, the pursuit of luxury goods may undermine civilizational reproduction. Consider sacrificing marriage for dreams, trading survival’s necessities for celestial aspirations, or compromising health for appearance. The Origin of Wealth’s assumption about reproduction is: genes prompt us to care about genetic continuation, but we don’t specifically calculate reproduction probabilities. This framework elegantly explains the paradoxical coexistence of wealth explosions with fertility declines, despite genuine living standard improvements6. While many attribute this to rising child-rearing costs, The Origin of Wealth’s framework reveals deeper dynamics—education, housing, healthcare, once survival necessities, are now transformed by consumerism into luxury goods. This metamorphosis of subsistence goods into luxury goods dramatically enhances social welfare, but at the expense of overall reproductive inclination7.

During the Malthusian era, stagnant per capita income implies that, in this equation, luxury goods and subsistence goods sectors must have progressed at identical rates. The greatest difficulty is that commercial and industrial sectors naturally progress more easily than agriculture. This is also where I cannot be fully convinced by the author. This section serves as the transition connecting economic analysis with evolutionary game analysis. The author uses population migration and regional trade as explanations: As previously established: heightened preference for luxury goods elevates social welfare. This attracts population influx, contracting the production possibility frontier. Equilibrium eventually restores. As shown\rThis seems to also accommodate the Lewis Turning Point.

Originally describing lake-bottom ecosystems—big fish eat small fish, but when small fish are depleted, big fish also struggle to survive, ultimately reaching equilibrium. $$ \\begin{cases} \\dot{\\varepsilon}=-{\\varepsilon }h\\left( \\theta \\right)\\\\ \\dot{\\theta}=-{\\theta }g\\left( \\varepsilon \\right) \\end{cases} $$ Therefore, the Neo-Cambridge School believes this equation resembles class struggle, interpreting it as the relationship between wage-output ratio and employment rate. But its explanatory significance is far more profound—the natural philosophy of mutual rise and fall is vividly embodied in this equation. For example, in today’s economy, everyone considers civil service the iron rice bowl, the safest choice. But if most people think this way, society loses wealth creation momentum, leading to collapse. The Keynesian liquidity trap follows similar logic. The Selfish Gene argues genetic competition best explains evolution. But this equation refutes this—in fact, mainstream biology also recognizes group competition plays a significant role in evolution. For example, within a species, each individual enhances reproductive organs or other conspicuous mating functions to achieve genetic transmission. But intra-group competition, viewed from inter-group competition, represents internal consumption. Cretaceous ostracod fossil evidence indicates—only populations with moderate reproductive organ length could persist. Longer reproductive organs actually lowered persistence probability8. Take Athens as an example: highly developed civilization, implementing democratic institutions, yet unable to withstand attacks from authoritarian Sparta. The reason: Athenian democracy increased luxury goods—art, oratory, democracy, literature—but didn’t enhance subsistence goods—military, agriculture, architecture. Thus, this prosperity attracted enemies’ covetousness without strengthening resistance capabilities. From this perspective, I believe The Origin of Wealth accommodates Why Nations Fail, even explaining why inclusive institutions fail in early stages. Also demonstrates the uselessness of time travelers 😄. In summary, if the luxury goods sector significantly outpaces the subsistence goods sector in growth, it becomes vulnerable to attack. Similarly, consider China’s Song Dynasty. This explains why evolution hasn’t made everyone morally superior. Like the Dark Forest in The Three-Body Problem9, malice becomes a survival good in group selection games. Thus we reach a conclusion—globally, subsistence goods and luxury goods grow at nearly identical rates.

Technology reinforces this trend, with the Industrial Revolution as the turning point10. Galor and Weil (2000)’s model contains two trade-offs: 1.

US and USSR competed at the same level; fascist vs. non-fascist competition also occurred at one level. As economies develop, competition victory effects magnify. Therefore, if the backward side overwhelms the other, dark rule persists longer. The sad conclusion: eternal prosperity doesn’t exist, but new prosperity always emerges. A thousand sails pass by the sunken boat; ten thousand saplings spring up before the withered tree. Prosperity always exists—this is the market’s resilience.

This inevitability constitutes “science.” This is why I find economic growth studies fascinating—model mathematics, economic intuition, historical accumulation all integrated. Macroeconomic speculation is indeed speculative. Involving nations, everyone seeks “unification”—one theory accommodating diverse development histories. From this perspective, economic growth cares more about goodness-of-fit than econometrics 🤧. Microeconomics seeks optimization, econometrics seeks credibility, macroeconomics seeks what? I can only summarize this feeling as “big-picture perspective.” When we realize economic growth is but a brief moment in historical rivers, while stagnant equilibrium constitutes history’s majority, we alleviate real-world anxiety. Tranquility endures, cosmic extinction is destined, but life cycles endlessly, continuously regenerating. Ultimately, this book’s philosophy aligns with The Lion King, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, Wisteria Waterfall15. Adam Smith’s The Theory of Moral Sentiments stated “humans pursue inner tranquility and pleasure.” Once abandoning being happy pigs to become suffering humans, we embark on this journey seeking inner peace. Isn’t this also pursuing luxury goods? 👨‍🎓 Personally, for knowledge seekers, historical explainability’s tranquility and inclusiveness are more precious than economics’ predictive power and practicality. Mencius said: I am good at cultivating my noble spirit. With knowledge, one embraces all phenomena, constantly striving.

Similarly, as evolutionary perspective extension, The Origin of Wealth shares with these books a “de-anthropocentric” angle. Consequently, I believe this book still has following issues: Two-sector vs. single-sector model debate. Precisely because population structure changes slowly16 with long-term inertia, Malthusian single-sector analysis aligns better with intuition. Since luxury goods and subsistence goods easily transform, specific characterization analysis presents difficulties. This book only intuitively describes luxury goods. What exactly is the relationship between luxury goods and genetic survival? If related to selection, how can transformation be so easy? Model assumptions. The model uses Cobb-Douglas production function—would growth paths differ using increasing returns to scale functions? After all, this is mainstream motivation for international trade. Empirical methods. The author also analyzes selection theory as tautological17. Unlike mainstream counterfactuals for same objects, this book’s method involves computer simulation of growth scenarios and seeking non-biological counterfactuals—undeniably completely different from contemporary economics’ mainstream methods. Utility sector economic growth rates and survival sector economic growth rates still lack mainstream econometric estimation strategies18. The author considers tautological definition-deduction as axiomatic discussion, neither self-proving nor requiring proof. Organizational agency: The Selfish Gene separately establishes memes, distinguishing natural and human societies. Applying evolution theory to social analysis offers fresh perspective but must address agency questions—for example, whether government structure and evolution are mutually causal, then definitely not unilateral evolution problem. What does organizational construction mean for luxury goods and subsistence goods development? In long human societal development, only morality and state appear formally inevitable. Personally, I quite like this evolutionary historical perspective. When trends fade, heroes exist but no stage; when trends prevail, sometimes heroes abound, sometimes mediocrity ascends, all creatures compete freely under frosty sky. Contingency, necessity, all compatible.

This book is actually a popular science introduction to the mathematics of economics for mathematics students. The interesting disciplinary stance is that mathematicians generally try to avoid normative analysis in social sciences and non-mathematical explanations of terms. Reading Difficulty: Intermediate microeconomics level, but since it is aimed at mathematics students, some parts exceed intermediate level. For example, intermediate microeconomics usually introduces Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem using tables, while this book directly uses functional analysis. Disciplinary History: This book can be seen as a history of the development of mathematics in economics. Many people finish studying microeconomics without understanding the development of mathematical tools. For example, many only know a couple of example problems from textbooks about the contributions of Cournot, Walras, and Arrow. The history of the discipline fills in the gaps, helping to understand the inheritance process of these masters. As I mentioned in The Arrogance of Economics: Some Recent Thoughts, I believe that learning the history of a discipline is very important. Understanding the history of the integration of mathematics and economics is also crucial. If you haven’t experienced the beauty of intermediate level, it’s hard to go far by immersing yourself in advanced mathematical techniques. Because economic thought is already fully permeated at the intermediate level, the advanced level is just a precise expression and generalization of the intermediate models. Reviewing the biographies of economists is actually quite interesting. Just as people are obsessed with commenting on contemporary economists and gossiping about the career moves of academic stars, in the history of mathematical economics, you can also see many familiar names who were once obscure in their papers until their contributions were later recognized. Ideology: In that era, using mathematical tools to analyze economics was considered to have a capitalist flavor. The book is full of this era-specific characteristic, with the author having to emphasize that they are critically viewing it and inserting discussions on Soviet socialist mathematical economics.

William Petty (William Petty) “Political Arithmetic”. This was the beginning of using numbers. 19th Century. Use of Functions: Cournot (Charles-François Gounod)1 (student of Paris Normal School, student of Laplace and Poisson) “Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth”. Many could not accept the mathematical expression of the price-demand function in the book, so Cournot wrote another version avoiding mathematics (but it still didn’t become popular). His contributions were only recognized 80 years after his death. Pioneers of Marginal Analysis: Gossen (Hermann Heinrich Gossen)2 was not accepted in his time because his mathematics was too advanced. The founder of the Austrian School, Menger (Carl Menger), who did not know calculus, described marginal analysis using intuition, which had a great influence. The Austrian School thereafter had few economists who actively used mathematics. Jevons (William Stanley Jevons) “A Brief Statement of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy” (1862), Walras (Léon Walras) (founder of the Lausanne School) “Elements of Pure Economics”. Both knew calculus, Walras was better at mathematics than Jevons. Menger, Jevons, and Walras all independently developed marginal analysis, but they later found that Gossen was the earliest, though he was not recognized. Expansion of Mathematical Models: Walras’s general equilibrium theory emerged. It proved the existence of prices that balance market supply and demand. However, Walras’s mathematics was not good enough; he thought that if the number of variables equals the number of equations, there would be a solution, without considering the rank of the equation system. Although the proof was not rigorous, the idea still had a profound impact. Von Neumann also thought about game theory based on general equilibrium. 80 years after Walras proposed the general equilibrium theory, Debreu (Gérard Debreu) “Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium” (1959) strictly proved the existence of general equilibrium. It is a necessary and sufficient condition with the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. Second Generation of Marginal Utility School: Edgeworth “Mathematical Psychics”, Marshall “Principles of Economics” (Marshall (Alfred Marshall)3 also had a mathematics background, representing the Cambridge School). Keynes (John Maynard Keynes)4 was a student of Marshall. Second Generation of Lausanne School: Pareto (Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto) (worked as a railway mining engineer for 20 years). American Marginal School: Fisher5 (Irving Fisher) inspired Keynes. Austrian School Follow-up: Menger’s son became a mathematician and brought out two important figures, one being Gödel (Gödel) of the incompleteness theorem, and the other being the statistician Wald (wald)6 (Wald test in econometrics). Schumpeter (Joseph Alois Schumpeter), though born in the Austrian School, had theories that almost dominated the field. The protagonist of the 2018 National Volume 2 essay question is Wald. Unfortunately, Wald died in a plane crash.\rThe most famous mathematical method in macroeconomics is control theory, which was formed by a group of free-spirited scientists in Vienna, including von Neumann. The first to seriously introduce control theory into economics was Alan Blinder (Alan Stuart Blinder). Earlier introductions of control theory are more commonly known through Phillips (Phillips)7.

You should study whatever object you want, and it’s best to accept the test, but the choice of research object should not be constrained. Do not be overly constrained by terms like xx-ism, xx school, xx needs, xx practice. The part of economics that frequently uses mathematics is empirical economics. But it is necessary to distinguish the goals of using mathematics, because many people hope that economics can achieve the same predictive power as physics through mathematics. But take physiology as an example, although we can dissect the heart, no one expects it to predict the heartbeat. The role of economics should be to cooperate with empirical analysis to form clear axiomatic expressions.

Cardinal utility theory is difficult to generalize, while ordinal utility theory is easier and can prove that cardinal utility theory has a corresponding suitable ordinal utility theory. Prisoner’s dilemma inspiration: local optimum does not equal global optimum, the key is not to be too dispersed, otherwise it is easy to fight internally. Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem is a网红 theorem, many people like to hang a title—mathematics proves that democracy is impossible. Buchanan developed public choice theory based on this, criticizing the effectiveness of collective decision-making. However, the contributor Arrow himself was very cautious: The philosophical and distributive implications of social choice contradictions are not clear, and there is certainly no simple way to resolve them. — Arrow Edgeworth Box: The exchange process is not necessarily equal, this is an equal opportunity, at every Pareto optimal point, the distribution between the two parties can easily be unequal, but the opportunity to achieve any result is equal. This reflects that procedural justice may be more important than outcome justice. Uncertain environments can help us determine cardinal utility theory. Shi Shuzhong approaches the macro part from the perspective of engineering control. The blogger  Song recommended “Cybernetics and Scientific Methodology” to me. In fact, some foreign universities in macroeconomics also require students to study control theory and dynamical systems. Walras and Pareto also received training in this area. Macro systems need to consider input, output, transfer, feedback, goal achievement, and optimal path (flowchart). Ordinary differential equations are closely related to control theory. If society is seen as a system, then the market is a regulator. For example, the following differential equations reflect the relationship between wage-product ratio and employment rate. $$ \\begin{cases} \\dot{\\varepsilon}=-{\\varepsilon }h\\left( \\theta \\right)\\\\ \\dot{\\theta}=-{\\theta }g\\left( \\varepsilon \\right) \\end{cases} $$ Mathematically, it is a nonlinear Volterra equation. Initially, it described the ecosystem at the bottom of a lake, where big fish eat small fish, but when the small fish are eaten up, the big fish also find it difficult to survive, eventually reaching an equilibrium.

Roughly knowing the direction of influence and weight of a factor in the market system. I also agree with a sentence from “The Origin of Wealth”: The most wonderful part of science is that it seems incredible before analysis, but after analysis, it seems inevitable. Many people quote Marx’s saying—A science is only truly perfected when it successfully applies mathematics. Actually, this sentence appears in Lafargue’s memoirs, where Lafargue said that Marx said this. Marx did not express this view in his own works. However, Marx’s mathematics at least reached Taylor expansion. Interestingly, although Marx learned some calculus, he did not realize that his theory of differential rent had the idea of marginal analysis. Marx also believed that the mystification tendency of mathematics was one of the reasons for its development. This can be found in “Marx’s Mathematical Manuscripts.” The successful mathematics in economics is actually an abstraction of the essence of phenomena. Through scientific abstraction, the internal mechanism of things is revealed. Can we achieve qualitative analysis without quantitative analysis? Although Adam Smith directly conducted qualitative analysis, after mathematization, people understood Adam Smith’s qualitative analysis more clearly. The journey from vague text to rigorous mathematical description is a long one, measured in centuries. The classic Cournot model in microeconomics discusses a type of duopoly game.

I felt that this was the second time I had lost a pet snake, but I couldn’t recall the first time—only the painful feeling of loss. I kept trying to convince my family that such a snake had existed (I was using the past tense to describe it, which might be a key point). On a stone table in the classic neighborhood grove, I kept telling them all my memories, but could only recall some vague landmarks. I searched everywhere, retrieving memories from the trash bin, the police station, and the museum. Trash Bin Memory: On my way to school, I found a transparent small box inside a larger box, containing a talking snake! I also remembered that the trash bin was divided into recyclable and non-recyclable, a world that seemed omnipotent. She was actually a talking snake. The snake and I watched videos and吐槽 together. But I couldn’t remember how it came to be, only fragmented memories of life. Police Station: I was parentless, driving a second-hand Changan truck collecting garbage. The Changan’s window was broken, patched with yellow tape, and the trunk couldn’t lock, so I propped it open with a support to load junk and goods. The snake turned out to be a descendant of Bai Suzhen’s lineage, an experimental subject. I was caught in the pursuit of an evil force, and the police were helping me.

You mentioned that this was the “second time” you lost the pet snake but couldn’t recall the first time, which might hint at a past experience of loss that was very painful for you.

Here is a detailed analysis of the dream: Beginning of the Dream: The relative girl pouring loaches into the basin triggered your anxiety and worry, as you were concerned it would harm your pet snake. This reflects your deep care and sense of responsibility for your pet in real life. Your fear and pain of losing the snake might represent your deep anxiety about losing something important. Lost Memories and Search: You felt that this was the second time you lost the pet snake but couldn’t recall the first time. This vague memory might symbolize a sense of loss you experienced in real life, but the details are blurry. You kept trying to convince your family and searched everywhere for the snake, reflecting your determination and relentless effort to retrieve what was lost. Memories in Different Scenes: Trash Bin Memory: This scene is full of fantasy. You found a talking snake and watched videos and吐槽 together. This might represent your deep desire and imagination of forming a strong emotional bond with a pet. The trash bin classification also reflects the complexity and diversity of modern society. Police Station: In this scene, you became a garbage collector, caught in the pursuit of an evil force. This might symbolize some困境 or challenge you face in real life, while the snake, as a descendant of Bai Suzhen, represents some信仰 or hope. The police assistance symbolizes your desire for help and protection in困境. Museum: This scene reveals that the snake sacrificed itself to save you and erased your memory. This might represent your deep experience of sacrifice and遗忘, also hinting at some无奈 and compromise with the real world. End of the Dream: When you remembered everything, you woke up. This might mean that you experienced profound emotional and cognitive awakening in the dream, thus ending this complex nested dream. Overall, this nested dream is full of fantasy, emotion, and deep symbolic meanings. It might reflect your care for pets, fear of losing important things,应对困境 and challenges, and deep experience of sacrifice and遗忘. By analyzing this dream, you can better understand your inner world and emotional needs.

Here are some possible interpretations: Symbolism of the Snake The snake might represent a part of your inner self—innocent, fragile, yet full of wisdom and power. This snake can talk, help you吐槽, solve problems, and even sacrifice itself to protect you, showing that it is not just a pet but also a spiritual companion or guide. Loss and Search In the dream, you keep losing and searching for the snake, which might hint at the loss of some important emotion or memory in reality. This repeated loss and retrieval might correspond to a process of losing and trying to regain yourself in a certain situation. Trash Bin, Police Station, and Museum These locations each have deep meanings: Trash Bin: Symbolizes parts of life that are neglected or discarded. Finding memories there suggests the need to revisit past experiences or emotions that have been forgotten. Police Station: Represents order and protection, but your experience in the dream is full of破碎 and pursuit, possibly reflecting your矛盾心理 towards authority or real-world rules. Museum: As a repository of memories, it reveals the truth about the snake, the evil force, and the sacrifice, seemingly reminding you that some truths from the past need to be accepted or let go. Sacrifice and Memory Erasure The snake’s sacrifice and erasure of your memory carry a strong tragic tone, perhaps reflecting your subconscious复杂情感 towards “forgetting.” On one hand, forgetting might be a form of self-protection; on the other, it comes with deep loss. Feeling After Waking Up You woke up after remembering everything in the dream, as if completing an internal integration in the subconscious. When memories, emotions, and truths converge, you achieve clarity—whether from the dream or some psychological困境. If this is a source of creative inspiration, the dream’s plot is very suitable as the mainline of a suspense story, especially regarding the symbolism of the snake, the conspiracy behind the experiments, and the protagonist’s growth. You could further expand it, adding more characters and background details to make it a fantastical and touching work.

The most amazing part of this nested dream is that the development of the dream corresponds to the foreshadowing earlier. But how can a dream have foreshadowing? How can it set up a呼应 framework in advance? This sense of design is astonishing. Snake: Since childhood, I’ve had many dreams about snakes. Although they are terrifying to me, I also find them somewhat positive because my zodiac sign is the snake. In The Lion King, Kung Fu Panda, and The Legend of the White Snake, snakes are portrayed positively, and there’s an ancient saying about snakes transforming into dragons. Talking Snake: Recently, I had a lot of discussions with classmates during a gathering, and writing my thesis also requires active communication with the team. Indeed, I have many thoughts on social interaction, communication, and barriers. I believe sincere communication is important, but sincere communication doesn’t mean others will believe you are sincere. This process is like the prisoner’s dilemma—the more it goes on, the higher others’ defenses against sincerity become. Museum: My favorite city attraction has always been museums. I believe in the power of museums—human history, dignity, and monuments. It’s fitting to retrieve memories in a museum. The police station is just something we, as Chinese, fully trust. Recently visited Jinsha Museum and the Sun Bird Totem\rGarbage, Changan Truck: My family is very harmonious. The scavenging and parentless aspects are classic anime settings. In my hometown, Changan trucks are often used for transporting goods. Forgetting, Sacrifice: Classic scenes from films like Your Name. At this stage, my dreams still have such情节,看来我还是挺向往童真的😄. The most impressive part of this dream is the realism of失忆 and寻找, and finally remembering everything gave a sense of fate. Desire: In this dream, I could clearly sense that the snake’s gender was female. Could it really be a reflection of desire? But I know that such an image is an ideal embodiment, just like the me on the blog is only a partial me. Anyone in reality is diverse and complete. To comprehend the abstract and sacred aspects of human nature, but in the pursuit, one must embrace the whole and concrete person.

What determines the development path of a state? I often use this question as an example in my blog1 — what is the origin of government? One school of thought is classical political economy, represented by social contract theory, public goods theory2, and social welfare theory. The establishment of power collectives stems from the need for collective optimization. Of course, how to measure social welfare itself is a philosophical question: minimum (veil of ignorance thought experiment3)? maximum? mean? absolute value? marginal value? designing weighted convex functions? Beyond this, conceptions of justice are also philosophical issues, such as Amartya Sen’s concept of freedom of choice; outcome equality in planned economies; endowment equality in initial distributions… Tax design resembles the trolley problem: one track has the poor, another the middle class, and another the wealthy — even considering that some might transform into Super Saiyans and overturn the table before being hit. Before introducing another school of thought, let’s look at the next question—what determines the development of a state. One major perspective is the resource endowment theory in international trade. Country A has 4 units of resource a and 2 units of resource b, but industry a is more profitable, so it naturally chooses industry a. Country B has only 0.5 units of resource a and 1 unit of resource b, making industry b more profitable, thus it develops industry b. Quantity of Resource A Quantity of Resource B More Profitable Industry Choice Country A 4 2 A Country B 0.5 1 B Therefore, even though Country A is superior in all resources compared to Country B, since it internally focuses on developing the most profitable industry A, it chooses industry A; similarly, Country B chooses industry B. This model (H-O comparative advantage) vividly explains why weaker countries with absolute disadvantages can still export goods to stronger countries. Professor Justin Yifu Lin proposed “New Structural Economics” based on this idea. The Origin of International Trade First stage view: Absolute advantage Second stage view: Comparative advantage Third stage view: Scale effect Fourth stage view: Heterogeneous firms In other words, this school of thought assumes that national development is determined by regional resources. The following distinctions about institutional economics are based on “Institutions and Economic Growth” (Yao Yang), a book about the dialogue between Professor Yao Yang and institutional economics master North. (Haven’t finished reading it yet, will supplement later.) Institutional economics disagrees. For instance, North argues that factors like investment, education, and capital accumulation are not causes of economic growth but manifestations of growth. If merely accumulating production factors could achieve development, theoretically all countries could imitate this, but reality proves otherwise. In fact, efficient organizations are the primary drivers of development. Meanwhile, resource endowment theory always assumes people rationally maximize their resource advantages. A simple counterexample is the partial emergence of deglobalization trends globally. Example 1. Coase used transaction costs to explain the origin of firms — explaining corporate emergence from an institutional perspective. This demonstrates that institutional emergence shares commonalities rather than being uniquely generated by resource endowments. Example 2. I prefer to explain institutional economics using an anthropological perspective — our cultural behaviors can be viewed as excessive rituals4. For example, cured meat: historically, cured meat served as preserved food for the New Year due to resource constraints, but now with abundant resources, its significance has transformed into an embodiment of New Year delicacies.

The term “functional” is “general” because it studies mappings from set spaces to set spaces; we study a class of mapping functions, or in other words, “general” refers to studying functions of functions; nonlinear functionals represent path optimization, refer to another blog post “Calculus of Variations Study Notes.” Some advanced microeconomic reasoning relies on sets as the space for decision elements: Let the set of social individuals be $I=\\{ 1,2,\\ldots,n \\}, n\\geqslant2$. $x,y \\in X$ are resource sets, allocated to individuals $a_i$, i.e., $\\sum_i^n a_i=X_i$. Preferences are as follows: $x\\succeq_{i}y$: individual $i$ considers $x$ no worse than $y$. $x\\sim_{i}y$: individual $i$ considers $x$ and $y$ indifferent. $x\\succ_{i}y$: individual $i$ considers $x$ better than $y$. As mentioned earlier, a functional is a mapping from space to space. A social welfare functional is a mapping from the space of individual joint preferences to the space of social preferences, denoted as $$ \\succeq^{F}=F(\\succeq_{1},\\succeq_{2},\\ldots,\\succeq_{n}) $$ Note, this is a mapping from the preference space of all individuals to social preferences, not necessarily a one-dimensional space ($R^1$). The joint preference space of individuals can be understood as the set of all individuals’ preference outcomes, and the social preference space can be understood as the final overall preference outcome space we should acknowledge. Next, let’s illustrate with examples: For a dictatorial society, social preferences are forced to conform to the preferences of one individual. $$ x\\succ_{h}y\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x\\succ y $$ Majority voting is a mapping where the minority follows the majority, comparing based on the aggregation of similar individual preferences. $$ N(x\\succ_{i}y)\u003eN(y\\succ_{i}x)\\Rightarrow\\quad x\\succ y $$ $$ N(x\\succ_{i}y)=N(y\\succ_{i}x)\\Rightarrow\\quad x\\sim y $$ May’s Theorem: The necessary and sufficient conditions for a social welfare functional to be majority voting are these three properties: Anonymity of majority voting means sequence identifiers $i$ within the same preference can be interchanged; Neutrality manifests as equal weight for each person’s vote; Positive responsiveness manifests as social preference changing direction aligning with some individuals’ preference direction changes. Majority voting seems ideal, but real-world voting encounters various problems; details can be found in the “voting paradox” (also called Condorcet paradox). Since preferences are based on ordinal utility theory (comparative), infinite comparison cycles might occur. Real voting is more complex; for example, swing states are crucial in US elections, and bandwagon effects or retaliatory mindsets also influence voting outcomes. Source: Wikipedia\rTherefore, we need to establish axiomatic conditions for social welfare functionals: Unrestricted domain: Every individual preference yields social preferences (social preferences must at least satisfy transitivity and completeness) Non-dictatorship: Supplement: anonymity imposes stronger constraints than non-dictatorship. Pareto principle: $\\forall i\\in A, x\\succ_{i}y \\rightarrow x\\succ y$ Independence: $\\forall x, y\\in X$ when $x\\succ y$ holds, any $i\\in I$’s preferences outside $\\{x, y\\}$ do not affect the social preference outcome $x\\succ y$. Independence actually simplifies the model, limiting voters’ considered information to current choices; this constraint is weaker than neutrality. Now we can introduce a voting scheme — Borda count. The core is ranking: each person ranks every option from 1 to n $c_i(x)$, with better options ranked higher, then summing each option’s ranks. $$ c(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}(x) $$ Smaller totals indicate stronger social preference. $$ c(x)\u003cc(y)\\quad\\Leftrightarrow\\quad x\\succ y $$ Seems reliable?

Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem proves that—when there are three or more options, this expectation is impossible. Decisive preference refers to situations where a specific group has the power to influence social preferences. Coalition $K \\in I$ $$ \\forall i\\in K, x\\succ_iy;\\quad\\forall j\\in I\\cap K^c, y\\succ_jx\\quad\\Rightarrow x\\succ y $$ That is, $I$ is divided into two preference positions, $K$ and $I\\cap K^c$, and even if their views are opposite, the final social preference may reflect the preference of $K$. Swing states in U.S. elections. The moment when votes are tied, the last vote becomes the tipping point. Celebrities taking a stance and their fans following. When the preference of coalition $K$ directly determines the social preference for options $(x,y) \\subset X$, then $K$ is a decisive coalition under the social welfare functional, denoted as $D_K(x,y)$. Again, note that the functional here is a mapping from space to space. Since $K$ determines social preferences, the preference of this coalition is the mapping from the joint preference space of individuals to social preferences. Naturally, when $K$ consists of only one person, it is a dictatorship. When unrestricted domain, Pareto principle, and independence are satisfied, the decisive coalition has the following properties: $(x,y) \\subset X$, there is a decisive coalition $D_K(x,y)$, then for $(u,v) \\subset X$, there is also $D_K(u,v)$. $K\\subseteq I,J\\subseteq I$ (the symbol means subset or equal) are both decisive coalitions, then $K\\cap J$ is also a decisive coalition. For any $K\\subset I$, either $K$ or $I\\cap K^c$ is a decisive coalition8. $K\\subset I$ is decisive, $J\\subset I$ is any coalition containing $K$, $J\\subset K$, then $J$ is also decisive. $K\\subseteq I$ is decisive, and the number of members is greater than 1, then there exists a proper subset $J\\subset K$ that is decisive.

The proof essentially uses the following properties: $(x,y) \\subset X$, there is a decisive coalition $D_K(x,y)$, then for $(u,v) \\subset X$, there is also $D_K(u,v)$. $K\\subseteq I,J\\subseteq I$ (the symbol means subset or equal) are both decisive coalitions, then $K\\cap J$ is also a decisive coalition.

For example, proving that a social welfare functional satisfying unrestricted domain, Pareto principle, and independence must be dictatorial: The entire society $I$ can be seen as a decisive coalition, and based on property 5, it can be infinitely decomposed into one. Then, using property 2, preferences are classified, verifying that this individual is indeed a dictator relative to other options.

Given Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem, Why Does Microeconomics Still Study Social Welfare Functions? Personal understanding: You can think of the dictatorship proof in Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem as the “last vote” that tips the scale. But the understanding needs to go deeper: Remember: Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem studies the mapping from individual preference space to social preference space. Because Arrow wants to solve the best mapping from individual preference space to social preference space, the most ideal democracy is one where there is no “tipping vote.” Absolute equality, where participation is through ranking rather than cardinal utility aggregation. Of course, there are already theorems proving the existence of transformations between ordinal and cardinal preferences. Assuming everyone votes once under unknown circumstances, there will always be one person whose preference determines (even if they don’t know they are the dictator of this game) the entire society’s preference, making the vote dictatorial. In other words, the mapping is not ideal and does not truly reflect the preferences of the majority. Assuming multi-stage games, people may change their votes based on retaliation, altering their preferences, which violates the independence assumption. If everyone changes their initial preferences to win, the mapping no longer reflects the best outcome. Ultimately, Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem aims to prove this point—mapping individual preferences to social preferences is fraught with difficulties.

The end of each story signifies a new state. In economics, perfect and imperfect endings are equilibrium and disequilibrium. A perfect story needs a curtain call, a prophecy of the ending state rather than just a summary of the past, which can be extended. Texts lacking actions and states do not qualify as stories. Economists emphasize starting with exogenous variables because, in the story system, this serves as the beginning. Starting with endogenous variables makes the story feel like it begins in the middle. This is also for speculative reasons.

In the author’s view, science is merely a way of speaking, not a domain of truth. Science requires texts to express itself. Scientific experiments are limited, and often people judge the value of a theory based on its aesthetic appeal. The methods of persuasion in texts are similar to literature and speeches. Thus, science, literature, and art intersect rather than oppose each other in the traditional sense. Personally, I reserve my opinion on this. Economic arguments employ the following argumentative methods: The first three points are from British scientific argumentation. From a literary perspective, the author expands these to more points. Statistical tests, specific market analysis, experiments on theories, introspection (What would I do if xx happened?), thought experiments (Based on experience, what would others do in xx situations?), case studies, folk wisdom (merchants), traditional academic knowledge, symmetry of laws (e.g., defining glorious periods and garbage periods), pure definitions, analogies… For example, economic papers do not describe the motion of objects but depict human behavior, which aligns with literary creation. Even though economic papers describe a category of people, readers imagine specific individuals rather than abstract object movements, a role depiction shared with literature.

If we conduct an experiment, we find that most people do not care about mathematical proofs or statistical details, but the mere presence of mathematics enhances persuasiveness. John Stuart Mill’s paper on expectations emphasizes the role of economics professors—criticizing people’s slow market expectations from the perspective of economic researchers. The author’s critique of economic forecasting is interesting—economic forecasts are always conditional, and conditional forecasts are inherently consistent with experience, so how can they truly exceed expectations? I have heard similar views from others—econometrics analyzes causality through exogeneity, so how can we expect it to predict exogenous events? Fogel used the method of sacrificing the small for the big, as he was refuting the mainstream conclusion that “railroad construction promoted U.S. economic growth.” Regarding x, y, coefficients—perhaps y is small; x is large; we overestimated the coefficient, leading to today’s conclusion. His paper uses hints of uncertainty to cast doubt on theories. Fogel Fogel was the first to compare railroads to river transport in terms of contribution, using historical quantification and counterfactual thinking, inspiring counterfactual causal inference. He argued that past views overestimated the contribution of railroads. Since his report, economics has also used quantitative history to revolutionize the paradigm of economic history.

But is this really the case? How big is a number? What counts as big or small is still a process of trying to persuade others, which still requires human comparison to reach a conclusion. Thus, the process still involves rhetoric. Of course, if you study advanced econometrics4, you will find that hypothesis testing constructs small probability events—“Type I errors” and “Type II errors” to test significance. Although this is considered standard practice, it is still a relative standard. I agree with Shi Zhentao’s view on econometrics teaching—“How big is credible” is not just a statistical question but also a philosophical one. Advanced econometrics merely makes people start thinking about this question. Shi Zhentao’s Zhihu Answer\rFor example, Bayesians and frequentists have long debated, and Bayesians themselves are divided into subjective and objective schools. While it all looks like mathematical derivation, the basic construction of credibility measurement always involves worldview. Everything can indeed be philosophical.

Too much real-world evidence does not guarantee full coverage. When a theory is tested, in economics, it often manifests as widespread interest in it.

In advanced econometrics courses, I see history students enrolling, while economics seniors are moving toward mathematics. The deep intersection of mathematics and economics is becoming the norm. Mathematical economists are joining, and standards are being raised. On the other hand, as mathematics and statistics are widely applied, their rationality is increasingly questioned. The instrumental nature of mathematics is indeed giving way to rhetoric. The themes, stories, and inspiration of papers are becoming more interesting to people. This trade-off, like “correctly reaching a conclusion” versus “reaching the correct conclusion,” leaves people unsure of how to choose and which direction will dominate. If we examine science solely based on “persuasion,” then all methodological rules become irrelevant. With such a liberal definition, worldviews might turn into function-oriented utilitarian thinking. But rhetoric, standing against modernism, undoubtedly offers a fresh perspective to examine science. Innovation requires boldness, and this freedom provides a springboard.

There is a clear distinction between these two.” ————《Adventures of Sherlock Holmes: A Scandal in Bohemia》 Although we live in a well-defined world today, our reflections on past behaviors never cease. From the origins of the universe to nations, whether in natural or social sciences, the quest is to trace a starting point to prove if everything we experience is inevitable or accidental. 《Crossing Boundaries of Community》delves into the formation of a Zhejiang Village, interspersing discussions on research methodology and theoretical construction, aiming to trace the origin of a community based on the concept of “relations.” For me, the ethnographic exploration in the book1 resembles a steady stream shaping rocks—each personal account may seem transparent and insignificant, but the intellectual rock will shine beautifully with time.

To make research questions engaging, the book emphasizes both contemporary issues and contradictions arising from existing theories. Rather than innovation, I appreciate the way the ideas are presented. The book examines Beijing’s “Zhejiang Village.” Despite being a cosmopolitan city, Beijing has a self-organized Zhejiang Village. This village is not a natural settlement or administrative entity, but a gathering point for Zhejiang immigrants. Xiang Biao’s theoretical framework is outlined as follows: Here is a note for studying the narrative logic of literature reviews. Phenomenon Characteristic: The village is a self-organized gathering point for Zhejiang immigrants in Beijing. This belongs to the issue of population movement. Theoretical Summarization: Existing theories suggest that population movement tends towards modernity from tradition. Xiang Biao summarizes various theories2 into a “tradition-modernity” framework, where these theories perceive tradition and modernity as being in a contradictory relationship. Theoretical Review: Coexistence, dependence, and embedding are three relations that can explain phenomena where backward and developed areas appear simultaneously due to population movement. However, coexistence theory lacks depth, dependency theory only touches on division of labor, and embedding theory addresses social structure without detailing its formation. Theoretical Contradiction: The process of community embedding has not been fully researched. Therefore, the paper focuses on social networks under population movement, studying the interplay of social networks, trust, and community formation as key to understanding Zhejiang Village’s emergence. New Theory Proposed: Emphasizing social network analysis, a series of theories already carry this idea3. Indeed, Xiang Biao’s theoretical views are quite similar to Yang Xiaokai’s Neoclassical Economics, though one explains communities and the other markets. The core logic revolves around these two points: A person appears independent, but when many connect, a market emerges, and individuals are influenced by social networks rather than acting independently. This logic chain—unseen hand-market economy-web model-general equilibrium-community formation—is summarized by Xiang Biao as “the fracture between the whole and the particular,” which may seem abstract, but essentially illustrates the internal contradiction of individual independence versus the collective’s dominance. Since social networks are always composed of people, we can analyze the entire social network through individual decision-making. This viewpoint is shared by Yang Xiaokai, Xiang Biao, and classical Bayesian network models, all emphasizing their theories that open the black box of the formation process while completing retrospective and unit analysis tasks 🤪. Yang Xiaokai’s marginal analysis focuses on consumer-producer individual general equilibrium, while Xiang Biao centers on relationships between individuals. In the “Thirteen Invitations,” Xiang Biao discusses the “disappearance of proximity” because he consistently advocates this market theory of individuals and social networks. The key difference lies in the fact that Yang Xiaokai builds upon Adam Smith’s division of labor creating wealth theory, starting from decision-making in labor division; Xiang Biao focuses on relationships forming a general equilibrium. Xiang Biao’s approach is more inclusive4, integrating ethics into analysis, providing ample room for exploring the ethical values, family structures, and collective ventures that shape Zhejiang Village.

However, social sciences, as seen in 《Crossing Boundaries of Community》, involve a more comprehensive scanning of scenarios, aiming for a richer depiction of human experiences, leading to a more encompassing understanding of the world5. I recall a classmate being astonished upon seeing a social science dissertation filled with everyday records—how could such mundane, unfiltered observations be considered academic work? Yet, sociology transforms self-awareness into consciousness. As Sherlock Holmes’ adventures highlight, it’s about observing, not just looking. When we review each chapter of 《Crossing Boundaries of Community》 individually, everyday trivialities might seem mundane. Everyone understands that post-reform entrepreneurship, institutional execution can be chaotic, and markets are driven by relationships. However, stitching together all chapters, Xiang Biao subtly constructs his “protruding facts.” Individual Traits: Zhejiang merchants prioritize relationships over kinship, valuing movement and entrepreneurship. Clothing technology spreads outward through kinship relationships. These ethical traits contribute to Zhejiang Village’s expanding social network and cultural characteristics. This process transforms individual characteristics into entrepreneurial, sales, industrial, market, and ultimately community relations6, from isolated individual action to collective movement. State Interaction: Why can’t states or eras alone explain Zhejiang Village’s formation? Zhejiang Village has its own framework, gradually marketizing, where many merchants accumulated wealth independently, rather than directly benefiting from reform. Zhejiang Village repeatedly clashed with Beijing’s administration, expanding through institutional reform, demonstrating its autonomous order. Through this relational perspective, more can be explained—systemic interactions, policy versus counteractions, class and tiered divisions, top-down interventions versus grassroots responses. This goes beyond mere mechanical opposition, delving into complex interactions driven by identity, rendering simplistic labels of advanced or backward meaningless, focusing instead on internal behavior and decision-making processes. This theory leans heavily towards liberalism—spontaneous order7 is disrupted by excessive intervention, and rather than control, understanding and acceptance are essential8. Entry Point: Xiang Biao didn’t begin with the intricate relationships shaping communities; his research initially focused on Zhejiang Village’s garment industry development. Over time, his studies unearthed relationships influencing community formation. Even discovering relationships was straightforward. China has traditionally been considered a society of interpersonal networks, but articulating community origins through relationships and population movement provides a mature narrative perspective.

Zhejiang Village, in its resistance to state governance, lacks a corporate enterprise model but thrives with unconventional vitality. Imagine if we were residents of Zhejiang Village, could we easily identify these traits? Alienation is a powerful analytical tool! However, this raises methodological debates—what role should researchers take when entering research subjects? How should they alienate the environment? Xiang Biao opposes abstract generalization, instead aiming to provide rational explanations through daily phenomena, crafting a self-organized order for Zhejiang Village. His inclusiveness and willingness to rationalize are admirable, but it reflects a moral choice—accepting phenomena and attempting to rationalize them. Constructing forward-thinking moral frameworks is difficult. Is there truly rational absurdity? Who decides which phenomena are absurd? These questions remain elusive, possibly contributing to why social sciences are not universally recognized as scientific.

This theory is quite intriguing as the addition of relations brings qualitative change. For instance, three separate lines are meaningless individually, but when connected, they form a triangle with significance. I resonate with a critique that economics often quantifies social networks and social capital, overlooking the influence of ethical values. Among those I’ve encountered, sociology students tend to be the most well-read. There are many fascinating details in these descriptions, proving Zhejiang merchants’ cultural and relational expansion, which are too extensive to detail here. I now understand why many recommend Hayek’s works, as his emphasis on spontaneous order and knowledge systems provides profound insights. However, Beijing’s Zhejiang Village has been dismantled by strong administrative measures, which long-term impacts might undermine the credibility of individual social networks.

The plot leans more towards suspense rather than pure logic, meaning the game’s true satisfaction lies in “recognizing the foreshadowing’s payoff” rather than “predicting the key twists.” When the finale ties everything together, that’s when true men shed tears. A true ending is always written for those who see the story through to the end, and this is where Shu Takumi’s storytelling shines the brightest. What I truly appreciate is the thematic crescendo in the cases throughout the first three games. First Layer: The Lawyer’s Stance—Pursuing Innocence. At this stage, the focus is on letting the evidence speak, fighting to the end, and never giving up on the defense. Second Layer: Introducing the Prosecution—Pursuing Truth and Trust. After the groundwork is laid in the first game, the lawyer appears as a towering figure. But what about the prosecution, responsible for securing convictions? The lawyer seeks to prove innocence, while the prosecution seeks to prove guilt. It’s through this clash over the same piece of evidence that a more objective perspective is gained. Thus, the truth is born from the battle between guilt and innocence. The key to the courtroom system is ensuring that both sides place their trust in it. When both parties adhere to their convictions, truth emerges from their collision. Third Layer: The Player’s Own Ethical Perspective. Though the story takes place in a fictional world, ethical philosophy often shines brightest in thought experiments. In the game, the pursuit of innocence by the player usually leads to a happy ending. But what happens when innocence is tied to a bad ending? This is the “contradiction” that the lawyer faces. Innocence that wounds the heart versus guilt that comforts it—the game presents the dilemma without offering a clear answer. (But the bonds of friendship still ignite a classic, heartwarming fire!)

We set off at 3 a.m., walking along the national highway beside the guesthouse. After spotting a tourism signpost, we found Yang Qilang’s tomb and temple nearby. Passing through the temple, we reached a dirt path leading into the mountains. The stone-brick road of the Great Wall was mostly in ruins, with only the bricks near the beacon towers remaining relatively intact. Starting from this point was particularly memorable because of the presence of a train tunnel. The first relatively complete beacon tower we arrived at. Around 4 o’clock, the sky was already glowing red.\rBecause we needed time for the door-to-door survey, we ended our climb at the third-to-last beacon tower. It was around four o’clock then.

Personal Reflections: Addressing climate change is indeed urgent. Gubei Water Town is blessed with ample water resources, with most of its land being irrigated fields, including many paddy fields. However, villagers reported that since 2018, the water levels have been declining annually, leading to many irrigated fields being converted into forested areas due to the decreasing water levels. The suburbs of Beijing aren’t much different from my hometown. It is generally believed that poorer areas tend to favor sons over daughters, but here, due to men’s jobs being insufficient to support a family and the bride price system, people actually feel it’s better to have daughters. The attitude of the residents reflects the quality of governance. In areas with rampant corruption, villagers clearly distrusted us, feeling that despite all the surveys, nothing changes: “We common folks, no matter how much we talk, it doesn’t help.” In well-governed areas with good welfare, every response was filled with gratitude towards the state, with villagers willing to comply with any government directives. I realized I am indeed quite careless! My fellow classmates, especially the female students, were much more meticulous than I was. Their questionnaire filling and reviewing were more rigorous, and I should learn from them. Survey Methods: Elderly party members and enthusiastic grandmothers make the best interviewees—they are attentive, sincere, and willing to actively cooperate with door-to-door surveys. When it comes to income-related surveys, respondents often understate their wealth. In such cases, it is important to observe the room (decoration, presence of a car, size, quality of furniture, etc.) and learn to ask disaggregated questions. For example, break down farming into the yield per mu, the number of mu farmed, and the price per jin. Similarly, use cross-verification by asking unexpected questions. For instance, when calculating income and expenses separately, ensure they balance. For household expenses, consider the number of family members and their consumption. When respondents are uncertain, set ranges—do you have 100 yuan? 200 yuan? The answers to questions can easily be manipulated. For example, asking if villagers come together to discuss solutions when faced with difficulties will invariably get a positive response. However, asking specific questions reveals more. After a recent storm in Beijing knocked down trees in many parks and schools, asking about the storm’s impact on their fields and if they sought collective solutions will likely reveal that everyone managed their own fields independently. Village-household integration. When implementing subsidy programs at the village level, the approach is often straightforward and crude. For example, the distinction between reforestation and ecological public welfare forests is blurred for villagers, who view both as tree planting for money. Subsidies are divided into planting subsidies and other types, but in the village, they are distributed together, making farmers think they get money just for planting. To address this, policies need to be broken down and explained in conjunction with villagers’ responses. Praise should be moderate. Each questionnaire typically takes about an hour5. To ensure cooperation, we often praise the respondents during the interview. However, if the praise is excessive, some attitudinal questions may receive overly positive responses, distorting the results. Moreover, for questions about marital harmony or neighborly relations, unless asked about neighbors, personal responses tend to be uniformly positive.

Some Problems and Solutions Authors: Jiafeng Chen; Jonathan Roth Journal: The Quarterly Journal of Economics （2024/3/30） DOI: 10.1093/qje/qjad054 Abstract Translation: When studying an outcome variable Y that can equal 0 (e.g., earnings), most researchers typically use a transformed average treatment effect (ATE) for estimation. This transformation can be represented as log (Y) when the outcome variable Y is large, and log (1 + Y) is usually used when Y equals 0. Our research finds that such logarithmic transformations of the average treatment effect should not be interpreted as percentage effects because the outcome itself is not a percentage, and the estimated average treatment effect depends on the units of the outcome variable. In fact, our study shows that if the actual units of Y are changed before performing a logarithmic transformation, treatment effects of any size can be obtained. This result arises because, for samples where the outcome changes from zero to non-zero during estimation, the percentage effect at the sample level is not well-defined, and the units of the outcome implicitly determine the weight given to the extensive margin in the logarithmic transformation of the average treatment effect. Further research reveals an “impossible triangle”: when the outcome variable can equal zero, it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy the estimation result as the sample’s average treatment effect, keep the units of Y unchanged (or independent of unit changes), and achieve point identification. We discuss several alternative methods that may be reasonable and feasible in settings with both intensive and extensive margins, including (1) expressing the average treatment effect in percentage terms (e.g., using Poisson regression), (2) explicitly calibrating samples on the intensive and extensive margins, and (3) separately estimating the actual treatment effects on the extensive and intensive margins (e.g., using Lee bounds). We illustrate these methods in three empirical applications.

Meaning of Coefficients After Logarithmic Transformation After taking the logarithm of a variable, it is generally believed that the coefficient reflects the percentage change. For example, lnGDP in a regression represents the percentage change in GDP. If it is reg lny lnx, the economic meaning of the coefficient is elasticity. See The Meaning of Taking Logarithms. For the following regression equation $$ \\ln y_n=\\alpha+\\beta x_n +\\varepsilon $$ the coefficient has the following economic meaning $$ \\begin{align} \\beta \u0026 = \\frac{\\ln Y_{n+1}-\\ln Y_{n}}{X_{n+1}-X_{n}}\\\\ \u0026=\\frac{\\ln \\frac{Y_{n+1}}{Y_{n}}}{X_{n+1}-X_{n}}= \\frac{\\ln (1+\\frac{Y_{n+1}-Y_{n}}{Y_{n}})}{\\Delta X}\\\\ \u0026= \\frac{\\ln (1+\\Delta Y \\% )}{\\Delta X} \\approx\\frac{\\Delta Y \\% }{\\Delta X} \\end{align} $$ Sometimes researchers perform logarithmic transformation because the data exhibits a long-tailed distribution, and logarithmic transformation makes the data more compact. Limitations of Logarithmic Transformation The core conclusion of the paper is that when the data contains zeros and the scaling units change (e.g., in labor economics, hourly wages, monthly wages, and weekly wages are often used, which involves unit conversion), the estimation of logarithmic transformation will change, making it unreliable. It is generally believed that the treatment effect obtained after logarithmic transformation is a percentage and is independent of the scaling parameter $\\alpha$. $$ \\small ATE=E[\\log(1+aY(1))-\\log(1+aY(0))]=E\\left[\\log\\left(\\frac{1+aY(1)}{1+aY(0)}\\right)\\right] $$ Further considering the data structure, changes will occur $$ \\begin{aligned} \\lim_{a\\to\\infty}\\log\\left(\\frac{1+aY(1)}{1+aY(0)}\\right)=\\begin{cases}\\log\\left(\\frac{Y(1)}{Y(0)}\\right)\u0026\\text{if }Y(1)\u003e0,Y(0)\u003e0\\\\ 0\u0026\\text{if }Y(1)=0,Y(0)=0\\\\ \\infty\u0026\\text{if }Y(1)\u003e0,Y(0)=0\\\\ -\\infty\u0026\\text{if }Y(1)=0,Y(0)\u003e0 \\end{cases} \\end{aligned} $$ The latter three cases in the above equation show that the estimated treatment effect may be affected. The paper’s discussion on the bias of logarithmic transformation is similar to the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE). ![Taking Employment Policy as the Research Object](/img/Is the Logarithmic Transformation with Zero Values Reliable-20240523094100269.webp) Taking employment policy as the object, the policy shock brings different responses to the treatment group. 0 represents the unemployed state, and 1 represents the employed state. Originally, the treatment group had unemployed people 0 and employed people 1, but after the policy shock, all became employed people 1. Originally in state 1 (employed), after the shock, still in state 1 (employed), but income still increased. At this time, the change in the explanatory variable is directly brought by the policy shock, which is the intensive margin. Originally in state 0, after the shock, became 1. The change in the explanatory variable is not only due to the policy shock but also due to the change in their own state, which is the extensive margin. Thus, the measurement of the treatment effect becomes the following situation: Therefore, the average treatment effect is also the sum of the mathematical expectations of the two marginal effects $$ ATT=E(ATT^{int})+E(ATT^{ext}) $$ If $lg(1+x)$ is used for transformation and the units are scaled, from thousands to units For the intensive margin, $$ \\begin{aligned} ATT_{1000}^{int}\u0026 =E{log(1000Y^{int}(1))-log(1000Y^{int}(0))} \\\\ \u0026=E{log(1000)+logY^{int}(1))-log(1000)-logY^{int}(0))} \\\\ \u0026=E{log(Y^{int}(1))-log(Y^{int}(0))}=ATT^{int} \\end{aligned} $$ For the extensive margin, This part is the part where the state changes from 0 to 1.

In elementary school, we began to encounter unknowns like $x$. In middle school, we started to learn about specific functions like $f(x) = ax + bx^2 + c$. In high school, we began to understand abstract functions like $f(x) = f(-x)$ and $f’(x) = f(x)$. In university, we started to learn about implicit functions like $y’ = y + y’’$, which solve a class of functions. As our study of functions moves from concrete to abstract, we begin to develop the ability to infer the form of a function based on its properties. Nonlinear functionals in functional analysis are functions of functions. Given specific functional characteristics, we can narrow down the range of functional forms and then select the optimal function based on constraints. For example, a firm choosing the optimal production process, or an architect selecting the best curve for a building… Previously, given a specific type of function, we sought extremum points; Now, given functional characteristics, we seek the best specific function. Generally, the characteristic constraints of a function can be expressed as $f(t, y(t), y’(t))$, which can be understood as $f(\\text{time}, \\text{state}, \\text{direction})$. As shown in the figure below, there are three functions from $a$ to $b$ that satisfy the functional characteristics. Which one is the optimal? This introduces the use of calculus to find the extremum of the functional path.

Writing $F$ as the common profit function $\\pi$, we get: $$ \\pi - P’ \\frac{\\partial \\pi}{\\partial P’} = c $$ Considering static monopoly, the monopoly firm makes only one pricing decision (more detailed static game theory also considers product differentiation, information asymmetry, game sequence, and firm entry/exit states). In this case, the profit function only depends on $P$ and not on $P’$ (since there is only one pricing decision, no price change occurs). Clearly, $P’ \\frac{\\partial \\pi}{\\partial P’} = 0$, so $\\pi_s = c$. Now, consider dynamic game theory on top of static game theory. After the first pricing decision, monopoly firms begin to make multiple pricing decisions. The profit function is now: $$ \\pi - P’ \\frac{\\partial \\pi}{\\partial P’} = \\pi_s $$ Here, the profit function $\\pi$ must depend on both $P$ and $P’$. Thus, consider the elasticity of $\\pi$ with respect to $P’$, denoted as: $$ \\frac{\\partial \\pi}{\\partial P’} \\frac{P’}{\\pi} = \\varepsilon_{\\pi P’} $$ Substituting into the dynamic monopoly game formula, we get: $$ \\varepsilon_{\\pi P’} = 1 - \\frac{\\pi_\\varepsilon}{\\pi} $$ In other words, in dynamic monopoly, firms should continuously adjust their profit functions based on this relationship.

Intellectual Origins: Marx vs. Adam Smith Yang Xiaokai defines the core of mainstream classical development economics as—division of labor is the source of economic growth, and economic growth is the core concept of development economics. Adam Smith’s logical chain: $$ \\text{Transport conditions} \\Rightarrow \\text{Market size} \\Rightarrow \\text{Division of labor} \\Rightarrow \\text{Economic growth} $$ With this logical line as the main axis, division of labor occupies the absolute core—the emergence of money and specialized division of labor are inseparable, and investment is a tool to optimize division of labor. William Petty’s logical chain: $$ \\text{Reduction in transaction costs} \\Rightarrow \\text{Promotion of division of labor} $$ Scholars like North and Max Weber link division of labor with capitalist expansion, forming what Yang Xiaokai sees as modern classical development economics: $$ \\text{Capitalist system} \\Rightarrow \\text{Transaction conditions} \\Rightarrow \\text{Division of labor} $$ The Contradiction Between Marx and Adam Smith In the courses I took on Marx’s “Capital,” the professor argued that Marx’s view is that division of labor determines the market, which is completely opposite to Adam Smith’s view. For example, according to Marx, the division between the propertied and the propertyless is a form of division of labor, which also brings class nature! Based on the labor theory of value, private property is undesirable, and this division of labor ultimately stems from property ownership. Adam Smith uses the “invisible hand” to avoid the part about “the bloody primitive accumulation of capitalism.” If we want to refute Marx’s view, we need to argue that division of labor indeed brings wealth growth. Yang Xiaokai’s inframarginal analysis should be able to address this point, and this contradiction will be mentioned later.

Classical Development Economics Yang Xiaokai advocates analyzing economic development from four aspects. This is the historical background of classical development economics—the rapid development of Britain in the 17th-19th centuries and the liberal reforms in 19th-century Europe. Geopolitical landscape Europe: Fragmented, low trade and defense costs, free cities developed before nation-states. China was the opposite. Ideology, moral standards, legal norms Europe: The pursuit of wealth legitimized commerce (e.g., the Glorious Revolution in Britain), and the Industrial Revolution accumulated substantial commercial wealth.

Refuting Keynesianism Economic crises and World Wars I and II led to excessive concentration of political power. But does the occurrence of an economic crisis mean the failure of the free market? No, because highly specialized division of labor always comes with contradictions that are difficult to coordinate and couple. In Yang Xiaokai’s view, economic crises are like the risk of accidents on a highway. Choosing to involve the government is like giving up the highway after a single crash, which is an overreaction. Using division of labor to explain economic crises: the cobweb model and the general equilibrium model from the perspective of division of labor. This is also the core contradiction in the debate between Lin Yifu and Zhang Weiying on industrial policy—government intervention can have adverse effects because it disrupts normal industrial division of labor, which is more severe than an economic crisis. However, please note that all this logic is based on the premise that division of labor determines economic growth. The disadvantage of backwardness is the same; imitation can only optimize short-term division of labor, which does not align with long-term natural market trends and will inevitably lead to problems. The Soviet Union’s planned economy made more people admire “social experiments”—attempting government intervention. But the Soviet Union eventually collapsed, so Yang Xiaokai believes the Soviet model also proves Keynes wrong. In my personal view, Yang Xiaokai’s argument ignores the injustice of colonial movements and skips over the economic causes of World Wars I and II, which might have been caused by the excessive laissez-faire market leading to unequal resource distribution. Perhaps the market brings efficiency but neglects fairness, leading to revolutions. Incorporating freedom into development is a historic moment in development economics. Exploring what is just and fair is also a historic moment in development economics. Hayek’s prophecy succeeded, but the correct answer does not mean the process was correct.

What is Inframarginal Analysis? Marginal analysis considers the allocation of resources, addressing the question of how much to allocate. But inframarginal analysis is about making choices, dealing with either-or contradictions. In life, people often face many choices between “yes” and “no.” For example: When you graduate from high school and need to choose a major for university, if you choose economics among economics, chemistry, and physics, it means you won’t attend chemistry and physics classes during university, but you will attend microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, and other economics electives. This means that before we perform marginal analysis on the time allocation for major courses, we first consider which major to choose—this preliminary decision-making process is the exploration of the national market’s division of labor. This additional process of choosing a major is inframarginal. From a mathematical perspective, we perform a two-step optimization analysis: Inframarginal analysis part: Find global multiple corner solutions, interior solutions, and compare total costs and benefits. For example, which has better market prospects—studying economics, management, or physics? At this stage, we cannot perform marginal analysis; we can only compare total costs and total benefits. After confirming a major, we then use marginal analysis to determine the time allocation for our studies, which is the marginal analysis of grades and time. For example, the Lewis Turning Point and public choice theory have not been mathematized in mainstream economics because of conflicting interests. The government does not seek to maximize social welfare but rather a game of interests among various parties. The urban-rural dichotomy is also a problem of conflicting interests brought by division of labor. Most importantly—whether it is equilibrium and Pareto optimality analysis or Marx’s economics, none can answer one question: Why can productivity improve through the improvement of division of labor when the production function and resource endowment remain unchanged??? So let’s return to classical operations research and control theory, and Yang Xiaokai also wrote a preliminary control theory. A very dated book. Yang Xiaokai’s books seem quite collectible, and second-hand ones are expensive. I chose to borrow from the library.

General Equilibrium and Network Analysis Yang Xiaokai believes that Marshall’s supply and demand analysis is limited to the relationship between two goods, making many things appear exogenous. The Difference Between Exogenous and Endogenous Generally, exogenous variables are used as fixed parameters, with unchanged values, usually referring to variables outside the model. For example, in the short term, technology and institutions remain unchanged, so they can be understood as exogenous parameters. Correspondingly, variables within the model are endogenous. In the long run, everything can change, so everything tends to become endogenous. Adam Smith did not elaborate on the “invisible hand,” and this process, like machine learning, is a black box. From the perspective of general equilibrium, due to the large number of commodity exchanges forming a trade circle, a huge trading network is formed, where many transactions influence each other, eventually reaching equilibrium, which is the embodiment of the concept of general. Therefore, Yang Xiaokai emphasizes the need for network analysis. Yang Xiaokai’s model endogenizes division of labor through network analysis, thereby demonstrating the spontaneous development of the market.

Many people criticize economics as a pseudo-science wrapped in mathematics, but here we mainly want to explain the reason for the formation of this paradigm. Economics strives to imitate physics, following the process of phenomenon-mathematical model-experimental verification. However, since social sciences do not have the powerful experimental verification of natural sciences, statistical verification is used as a substitute. Whether it is Yang Xiaokai’s neoclassical development economics or Lin Yifu’s new structural economics, both derive conclusions from international trade. Similarly, when a theory encounters phenomena it cannot explain—in the field of international trade, it is the Leontief Paradox—patches or revisions are needed. Many people use human irrationality to refute economics, but in fact, there are many theoretical patches in this area. If one wants to establish a new framework, it must also be compatible with the phenomena described in the above flowchart. For example, later, Paul Krugman found that even without comparative advantage, increasing returns to scale can increase trade. (However, some people criticize Nobel laureate Krugman for being more of an economic writer.) Marc Melitz explains the emergence of international trade at the firm level, and many believe this theory will eventually win a Nobel Prize. Yang Xiaokai extended the consumer-producer trade model based on Ricardo’s trade theory. Each individual (unlike countries and firms) is both a consumer and a producer, allowing us to understand international trade from an individual perspective. Domestic trade is a necessity, and international trade is caused by exogenous comparative advantage, with transaction costs affecting individual choices in both domestic and international trade.

Of course, Xiangzi only focused outward, believing he had seen the world clearly. Yet, he overlooked one thing—looking outward enables one to see all corners of the external world but leaves one unable to see oneself clearly, making it impossible to discuss oneself and this era. As the protagonist, perspective is always outward, but as readers, we can observe the “world and me,” then reflect inwardly. Therefore, as Lu Zhishen said, “Only today do I realize who I am,” and I believe he meant precisely this. The best TV shows often feature this twist, much like a marvelous painting, whose stunning exterior alone is enough to captivate viewers. However, if the underlying structure and concepts can move people further, it truly becomes art. The discussion on fate in 2023 could cater to both the chroniclers and the absurdists.

With snow falling for 20 years, he’s never managed to overcome this hurdle, constantly haunted by ghosts of the past. In a moment of silence, he asks his son Wang Yang, “Do you believe in fate?” Wang Xiang and Biaozi can’t make sense of life anymore, both beginning to believe it’s all just “fate.” In “Blossoms Shanghai,” Wong Kar-wai depicts missed opportunities, with Ah Bao and four women—Xuezhi, Lingzi, Miss Wang, and Lili—all missing out. Their mismatched wealth, locations, identities, and experiences lead to emotional twists and turns. It’s said, “From the start of Zhi Zhen Garden, all outcomes were already predetermined,” and “Everything is the inevitable fate.” Walking in the vortex of fate, people will eventually drift apart, leaving only themselves behind.

I put on that stupid and incomprehensible face of God.” In “Journey to the West (sff),” Tang Zhijun believes that fate is guiding him to find extraterrestrials. Every coincidence is inevitable.

Wang Xiang corresponds to the snap of a finger, as one case has kept him stuck for twenty years. Initially, he believed that only through his diligent efforts could he avoid being laid off. The turning point comes during a workers’ meeting when the truth is revealed—the factory owner fires and retains workers at will, and the asset stripping is his doing. Finally, Wang Xiang erupts, realizing the decay within Northeastern factories. Unable to resist the changes of the era individually, he, like the essence of “One Sentence Is Ten Thousand Sentences,” strives to grasp the answers he seeks and continues looking forward.

However, this process is not portrayed coherently. From the perspective of the protagonist, of course, nothing is impossible. But as readers, we discover the relationship between “people and the world.” When confronted with the insignificance of individuals in an era beyond their comprehension, fate is simply glossed over. Journey to the West (sff)\rMost people question fate, receiving answers such as “There is only relative fairness, not absolute fairness,” “Heroism is still loving the world even after seeing its true nature,” and “The world kisses me with pain, and I return the favor with song.” At this point, the truth is irrelevant; what matters is maintaining a positive attitude toward survival, regardless of whether it’s right or wrong. When one insists on researching the relationship between individuals and the tides of the times, these answers are insufficient[^1]. Either one falls into madness or learns to compromise—accepting everything, living for tomorrow, and looking forward. This is the philosophy of survival: some things are proven to be unattainable, yet there’s an itch to obtain them. This is the interplay between fate and humanity—giving up on thinking is one solution, continuing to think until collapse is another, and continuing to think until compromise is yet another. These are just a few ways of coexisting with fate. Keynesians are always right to oppose the market. ↩︎ ","date":"2024-03-08","objectID":"/en/posts/kj_2024/:6:0","tags":["Episode","Philosophy"],"title":"watching  in 2024 : Various Approaches to Coexisting with Fate","uri":"/en/posts/kj_2024/"},{"categories":["Hugo Build"],"content":" The method to customize fonts in each Hugo theme varies, and there are few resources online explaining how to modify fonts in Hugo.

What are the causal frameworks? Today, with numerous causal frameworks emerging and various disciplines such as statistics (including pharmacology and psychology, each with its own statistical interpretation), economics, and computer science having their own schools of thought, the landscape has become intricate and diverse. It is intertwined and complex, and I am not entirely sure about the overall system. Personally, I have been exposed to Judea Pearl’s Structural Causal Model (SCM) the most. Regarding his work “The Book of Why,”1 My personal understanding is that association-intervention-counterfactual represents the three levels of causality. The selection of control variables controls for backdoor paths, while setting instrumental variables controls for frontdoor paths. Correlation does not imply causation; correlation does not discuss directionality. Causality is unidirectional, so we need directed acyclic graphs to guide us. After identifying pathways, we then analyze to envision a counterfactual world.\rThe knowledge about ATE (Average Treatment Effect), ATT (Average Treatment Effect for the Treated), ITT (Intention-to-Treat), and LATE (Local Average Treatment Effect) appears sporadically in “Mostly Harmless Econometrics” 1. The entire framework is based on Donald Rubin’s proposal of the Potential Outcome Framework (also known as Rubin Causal Model, abbreviated as RCM). It’s interesting that Judea Pearl (in “The Book of Why”) proposes that counterfactuals under causal pathways are the same as Rubin’s concept of “potential outcomes.” However, Rubin responded that the two are completely different 2and does not endorse the analysis method of path diagrams. (Personally, I find it difficult to understand Rubin’s response, as in my view, the direction of arrows in SCM corresponds to the direction of addition and subtraction signs in RCM). As far as I know, causal analysis in statistics is currently divided into frequentist and Bayesian schools of thought. Research is conducted to understand causal inference through Markov chains. Personally, I am quite unfamiliar with this area of knowledge. My understanding of this topic mainly comes from educational videos by Fmajor on Bilibili. 2. More details about RCM ATE (Average Treatment Effect), ATT (Average Treatment Effect for the Treated), ITT (Intention-to-Treat), and LATE (Local Average Treatment Effect) are different statistical estimators.

However, this type of group comparison is just the starting point for causal discussions. It is necessary to further decompose these group differences to explore causal relationships. Average Treatment Effect (ATE): The difference between the means of two groups is directly used as the estimator. It can be considered as the difference between the population means or as the mean difference between groups (e.g., in the estimation of twin data): $$\\bar Y_1-\\bar Y_0=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{Y_{i}(1)-Y_{i}(0)}{N}$$ Treating $D_i$ as the treatment variable, where $D_i = 1$ represents the experimental group and $D_i = 0$ represents the control group, the linear equation is as follows: $$\\begin{align}Y_{i}\u0026=\\begin{cases} Y_{1i} \\quad if D_i = 1 \\newline Y_{0i} \\quad if D_i = 0 \\end{cases} \\newline \u0026=Y_{0i}+(Y_{1i}-Y_{0i})D_{i} \\end{align}$$ Subtracting the two equations, we obtain the following expression: $$\\begin{aligned} \u0026\\mathbf{E}[Y_{i}\\mid D_{i}=1]-\\mathbf{E}[Y_{i}\\mid D_{i}=0]\\newline\u0026 =\\color{red}{\\underbrace{\\mathbf{E}\\lfloor Y_{1i}\\mid D_{i}=1\\rfloor-\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]}_{\\text{ATT}} } \\newline \u0026+\\underbrace{\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]-\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=0]}_{SelectionBias} \\end{aligned}$$ Where $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]$ is intentionally introduced by us, representing another “parallel universe” that we wish to explore but cannot directly observe—assuming that the subgroup represented by $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{\\color{blue}{1i}}\\mid D_{i}=1]$ did not receive the treatment in the parallel world. Their state is denoted as $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{\\color{blue}{0i}}\\mid D_{i}=1]$, which is the “potential outcome” that Rubin aims to find. $\\color{red}{\\mathbf{E}\\left[ Y_{1i}\\mid D_{i}=1 \\right] - \\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]}$ represents the Average Treatment Effect on Treated (ATT). There is no better controlled experiment than “a binary choice splitting into two parallel universes”, but no one can truly obtain such data! Therefore, economists attempt to estimate ATT through ATE, hence the introduction of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). ","date":"2024-02-28","objectID":"/en/posts/effect/:1:0","tags":["Literature Review","Causal Effec"],"title":"Causal Effec","uri":"/en/posts/effect/"},{"categories":["Economic Study"],"content":"RCT: Making ATE approach ATT RCT stands for Randomized Controlled Trial, representing a randomized experiment. Under the conditions of a randomized experiment, ATE = ATT. Next, let’s delve into the explanation: Subtracting the subgroup $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]$ from the subgroup that has never received treatment in the real world $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=0]$, if the result is non-zero, selection bias occurs. The reason may be sampling selection bias: for example, conducting a fitness-related survey only at gyms would definitely not achieve effective comparison; another example is the well-known survivorship bias in the military, where the returned planes are the ones that survived, making it unreliable to estimate the areas that need reinforcement based on their damages. It could also be self-selection bias: for example, an uneven gender ratio in admissions does not necessarily indicate discrimination, as this analysis overlooks the gender ratio in application tendencies. Some genders may be more inclined to apply for more challenging positions, leading to higher rejection rates; police enforcement focusing more on a certain race does not necessarily imply discrimination, as it may simply reflect higher crime rates within that race. Omitted variables, model errors, measurement errors, and insufficient sample size can all contribute to bias. If we use the method of randomized trials, the samples are randomly distributed. We hope that this randomized trial can average out some unobserved influencing variables, thereby making $D_i$ and $Y_{0i}$ independent, which means $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]=\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=0]=\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}]$. At this point, the estimation of ATE has been effectively simplified: $$\\begin{aligned} \u0026\\mathbf{E}[Y_{1i}\\mid D_{i}=1]-\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]\\newline\u0026=ATT =\\mathbf{E}[\\mathbf{Y}_{1i}-\\mathbf{Y}_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1] \\newline \u0026=ATE=\\mathbf{E}[Y_{1i}-Y_{0i}] \\end{aligned}$$ Further estimating through regression equations: $$\\begin{align}Y_{i}\u0026=\\begin{cases} Y_{1i} \\quad if D_i = 1 \\newline Y_{0i} \\quad if D_i = 0 \\end{cases} \\newline \u0026=Y_{0i}+(Y_{1i}-Y_{0i})D_{i} \\newline \u0026 =\\alpha+\\rho D_i+\\eta_i \\end{align}$$ $$\\begin{aligned}\u0026\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[Y_i\\mid D_i=1]=\\alpha+\\rho+\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[\\eta_i\\mid D_i=1]\\newline \u0026\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[Y_i\\mid D_i=0]=\\alpha+\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[\\eta_i\\mid D_i=0]\\end{aligned}$$ We can obtain the difference between the two. $$\\begin{aligned}\u0026\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[Y_i\\mid D_i=1]-\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[Y_i\\mid D_i=0]\\newline \u0026=\\underbrace{\\rho}_\\text{Treatment effect}+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[\\eta_i\\mid D_i=1]-\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[\\eta_i\\mid D_i=0]}_\\text{secletion bias}\\end{aligned}$$ When there is selection bias $\\eta_i \\neq 0$, it means that the residual is correlated with $D_i$. We emphasize randomized trials because we hope that random intervention experiments can make the two unrelated, eliminating this selection bias. So when randomized trials are satisfied, $\\eta_i=0$, $ATE \\xrightarrow{RCT} ATT$. This also tells us why we should pay attention to residual analysis.

Although randomized intervention trials are useful, the variables we want to study are not always randomly distributed. For example, industrial land tends to aggregate around certain grades of land. In this case, buyers are not randomly distributed. In such scenarios, we consider other randomly distributed variables that may influence their decisions. It’s more illustrative to first understand this using the path diagram of SCM: Angrist (2011) is a paper that examines the impact of participating in the Vietnam War on income. In this study, the variable of military enlistment was found to be problematic, so the author used enlistment eligibility as an instrumental variable. (Nostalgic for the era of short 6-page econometric papers) 2SLS\rClearly, there exists a process where an individual is first informed of their enlistment eligibility and then decides whether to enter the military. The ITT equation is as follows: It can be observed that the ITT estimate is quite similar to $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{i}\\mid D_{i}=1]-\\mathbf{E}[Y_{i}\\mid D_{i}=0]$, meaning that when $D_i$ and $Z_i$ are one-to-one corresponding, i.e., when $z=d$, ITT = ATE. $\\pi_N$: Regardless of whether I am eligible or not, I will never join the military. $\\pi_D$: Contrarian attitude, I will join the military if I am eligible, and I will refuse if I am not eligible. $\\pi_A$: Regardless of whether I am eligible or not, I will always join the military. $\\pi_C$: Compliance, I will join if eligible, and I will not join if not eligible. The source of the diagram is the Oxford courseware (Week 4 lecture): https://andy.egge.rs/teaching/causal_inference/\rDue to the non-random distribution of $Di$, as we are based on a sample of military personnel for statistics, we have only the following equation: $$\\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{E}[D_i=1|Z_i=0]=\\pi_A+\\pi_D\\newline \\mathbf{E}[D_i=1|Z_i=1]=\\pi_A+\\pi_C \\end{aligned}$$ In this case, we cannot estimate $\\pi_i$ separately for $\\pi_i$ , $i∈{A,C,D,N}$. However, due to the random distribution, the results will be proportional, allowing us to derive a linear equation: The solution is to make an assumption — quite reminiscent of an economics joke. Here’s the original joke: A physicist, a chemist, and an economist are stranded on a deserted island, starving. Suddenly, a can of food washes ashore. The physicist says, “We can use rocks to apply momentum to the can, causing its surface to fatigue and rupture.” The chemist says, “We can make a fire, then heat the can, causing it to expand until it bursts.” The economist then says, “Let’s assume we have a can opener…” After introducing the assumption, we directly obtain the LATE: $$\\mathrm{LATE}=\\mathrm{CATE}_{\\mathcal{C}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{ITT}}{\\pi_{\\mathcal{C}}}$$ $$\\small \\hat{\\mathbf{CATE}_C}=\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\Big[Y_i|Z_i=1\\Big]-\\mathbf{E}\\Big[Y_i|Z_i=0\\Big]}{\\mathbf{E}\\Big[D_i|Z_i=1\\Big]-\\mathbf{E}\\Big[D_i|Z_i=0\\Big]}=\\frac{\\mathrm{effect~of~}Z_i\\text{ on }Y_i}{\\mathrm{effect~of~}Z_i\\text{ on }D_i}=\\frac{\\operatorname{ITT}_Y}{\\operatorname{ITT}_D}$$ The LATE section heavily relies on the Oxford course material. For a more algebraic explanation, refer to the Harvard course material and “Mostly Harmless Econometrics.” Social science attributes in mathematical economics The social science attributes in mathematical economics are evident in the need to articulate assumptions that capture social phenomena. For instance, when studying unique policies, it’s essential to argue that the policy affects everyone, reflecting the assumption of monotonicity. Similarly, when using instrumental variables, it’s crucial to discuss the social relationship between the instrument and the explanatory variable. These assumptions serve as concise descriptions of social phenomena, highlighting the distinct social science nature of economic analysis.

Here, it is assumed that the returns to education are linear and the returns to work experience are nonlinear for the logarithmized wages. Heckman et al. (2006) empirically tested this assumption in their related research 2. Even if we don’t discuss the specific form of the equation, such a decomposition of variables is certainly insufficient. As the famous bread hunter DIO once said—— “JOJO, in the brief span of a human life, I have discovered… The more one plays with schemes, the more limited one finds the capabilities of humanity to be…” Indeed! Human lifespan and physical stages are points we cannot ignore! Once we delve into labor economics, we cannot avoid discussing human age and condition. Bread Hunter——DIO\rFirstly, let’s consider the lifecycle. Even if individuals have the same education level and work experience, or even higher, the rate of return on education varies with age. Here, we estimate parameters that are age and time-related. Moreover, the historical context in which each individual exists also influences wage earnings. For instance, movements like “going to the countryside” and “reform and opening up” deeply affected specific cohorts. Here, we estimate parameters (usually categorized by birth year) that are related to individual cohorts and time. Additionally, time effects (including economic cycles and linear growth, such as wage inflation) are also related to time! All these parameters are time-dependent! Decomposing them in the econometric equation becomes a significant challenge. Hence, we have the following extended and flexible Mincer equation. $$ln(w_{ict})=\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict}$$ $i$ represents an independent number. $c$ represents the group number, for example, one group was born during the reform and opening up, one group was born when people went to the mountains and countryside, and one cohort group 3. In the life cycle, work experience is generally divided into groups. The descriptive statistics in the figure below are preliminary descriptive statistics of the life cycle carried out by comparing groups after five years of grouping. $t$ represents the time variable. $\\theta(s_{ict})$ represents the education income function, $f(x_{ict})$ represents the work experience income function, $\\gamma_t$ represents the queue effect of group $c$, $\\chi_t$ represents the group queue Effect, $\\varepsilon_{ict}$ is the paper. Individual-level panel data is often challenging to obtain directly. Therefore, Deaton proposed: “We don’t need individual tracking panels anymore! Your room has no space left for you to obtain positions! We’ll synthesize a ‘pseudo-panel’ from repeated cross-sections of census data! Epidemiology, drug trials, social psychology, and other statistical fields all make use of such pseudo-panels. For example, in the figure below: These income comparison data are not from individual tracking panel data but rather from a pseudo-panel constructed from cross-sectional data of different ages at the same time.” Life cycle wage growth across countries(2018）\rThis type of panel data requires consideration of age, time period, and cohort as independent variables, also known as the Age-Period-Cohort Model (APC). In labor economics, the estimation of APC panel data has always been a hot topic (endorsed by the great Deaton, after all, it is a framework he established in economic analysis). For the estimation equation: $$ln(w_{ict})=\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict}$$ When we directly regress APC data, we encounter the problem of collinearity—age + birth year ","date":"2024-01-19","objectID":"/en/posts/hlt/:1:0","tags":["Literature Review","Stata"],"title":"HLT: Lifecycle and Wage Decomposition","uri":"/en/posts/hlt/"},{"categories":["Economic Study"],"content":"Deaton’s approach（mathematical Decomposition） Angus Deaton, who won the Nobel Prize in 2015 for his research on poverty, has made significant contributions to labor economics, with much discussion focused on his findings that aid may worsen conditions 4.

Define $\\bar{F}_t = \\sum*{c\\in C_t} F_{ct}$, then proceed to separate this part out, transforming it as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} W_{t}=\u0026 \\sum_{c\\in C_{t}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{ct}}w_{ict} \\newline \u0026=\\sum_{c\\in C_{t}}\\exp(\\alpha+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c})F_{ct} \\newline \u0026=\\exp(\\alpha)\\exp(\\gamma_{t})\\sum_{c\\in C_{t}}\\exp(\\chi_{c})F_{ct} \\newline \u0026=\\exp(\\alpha)\\exp(\\gamma_{t})\\bar{F}_{t}\\sum_{c\\in C_{t}}\\exp(\\chi_{c})\\frac{F_{ct}}{\\bar{F}_{t}} \\end{aligned}$$ At this point, wages can be decomposed into three parts: time effect $\\Gamma_{t}$, the effect of work experience and education $\\bar F_{t}$, and cohort effect $\\bar X_{t}$. $$W_{t}=\\underbrace{\\exp(\\gamma_{t})}_{\\Gamma_{t}}\\bar F_{t}\\underbrace{\\sum_{c\\in C_{t}}\\exp(\\chi_{c})\\frac{F_{ct}}{\\overline{F_{t}}}}_{\\tilde{X_{t}}}$$ The effects of work experience and education can be quantified through the years of education and work, but identifying the time effect and cohort effect is challenging. Therefore, the purpose of this approach is to isolate and study the time and cohort effects separately. Hence, we define: $$\\Omega_{t}=\\frac{W_t}{\\bar F_{t}}=\\Gamma_{t}\\bar{X}_{t}$$ In studying cohort and time effects, we typically approach it from two perspectives. Time trend: Our technology always advances over time, representing a time trend that progresses on average. Cyclical variations: For example, seasonal vegetables have cyclical supply and demand patterns, or the baby boom generation—when the baby boomers reach middle age, there may be a peak in the labor force. time effects\rAt this point logarithmize again—— $\\omega_t=\\log\\Omega_t,\\bar{\\chi}_t=\\log\\bar{X}_t，\\bar{\\gamma}_t=\\log\\bar{\\Gamma}_t$ ​ At the same time, it should be emphasized that what is defined is that $\\bar{\\chi}_t$ and $\\bar{\\gamma}_t$ are the deviations of the sample mean at this time. Just like we assume that the sum of residuals after regression is 0, this assumption also requires that the sum of sample mean residuals is 0: $$\\frac1T\\sum_{t=0}^T\\gamma_t=\\frac1T\\sum_{t=0}^T\\bar{\\chi}_t=0$$ At this time, the formula is decomposed into: $\\omega_t=\\bar{\\omega}+\\bar \\gamma_t+\\bar{\\chi}_t$ The original paper only stated that $\\bar{\\omega}$ is “an appropriately chosen constant”. Personally, I think it is the sample mean, so in contrast, $\\bar{\\chi}_t$ and ${\\bar \\gamma}_t$ are the deviations from the sample mean. At this time, both the time effect and the queue effect can be decomposed into time trend$g$ and periodic change $u$, which can be expressed by $gt+u$, and the following decomposition is obtained: $$\\gamma_{t}=g_{\\gamma}t+u_{\\gamma,t},\\quad\\bar{\\chi}_{t}=g_{\\bar \\chi}t+u_{\\bar \\chi,t}$$ We make $g_{\\omega}=g_{\\bar \\gamma}+g_{\\ba","date":"2024-01-19","objectID":"/en/posts/hlt/:2:0","tags":["Literature Review","Stata"],"title":"HLT: Lifecycle and Wage Decomposition","uri":"/en/posts/hlt/"},{"categories":["Economic Study"],"content":"Quantitative decomposition That is to say, the following formula is estimated: $$\\log(w_{ict})=\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+\\sum_{x\\in\\mathbf{X}}\\phi_{x}D_{ict}^{x}+\\gamma_ {t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict}$$ $\\theta(s_{ict})$ represents the income function of educational age, which is generally expressed linearly. $D_{ict}^{x}$ is a dummy variable for each age group in the life cycle. tip Let’s review the knowledge points about dummy variables (dummy) in measurement: Generally, n categories are used to generate n-1 dummy variables to avoid collinearity. That is to say, if there is a period of 5 years, 30 years will be divided into 6 periods, so the period of 0-4 years is generally omitted and 5 dummy variables are generated. The generated coefficients are all conclusions drawn from comparing with the missing parts. In other words, each coefficient is compared to the growth level in the 0-4 years segment. $\\gamma_{t}$: time effect. $\\chi_{c}$ individual effects. Directly use this formula to regression, $D_{ict}^{x}$, $\\gamma_{t}$, $\\chi_{c}$ have collinearity, the Deaton method is to give $\\gamma_{t}$, $\\chi_{c}$ imposes an additional linear constraint. When we set only the queue effect and the time effect to 0, we need to satisfy $\\sum_{t=0}^{T}\\gamma_{t}t=0$.

If you want to see the super-detailed derivation, it is recommended to check out “Disentangling age, cohort and time effects in the additive model” (McKenzie et al., 2006) 6. For the estimated formula: $$ ln(w_{ict})=\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict} $$ Direct regression will have the problem of collinearity - age + year of birth = current year. We cannot directly estimate the form of $\\gamma_t$ and $\\chi_t$ (such as concavity and convexity), but we can use the difference method to study the properties of high-order differences after group subtraction, and then estimate low-order differences. In the life cycle model here, the years of education are linear estimates and easy to decompose, so we ignore 7 for now. The individual number is $i$, and the queue is grouped $c$ according to the life cycle. $k$ is the work experience, which is equal to $t-c$. The corresponding equations for each group of queues are as follows: $$ y_{ct}=\\alpha+\\beta _kx_{ct}+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ct} $$ **Emphasis! In other words, the estimate of $\\color{red}{k}$ of $\\beta_{\\color{red}{k}}$ is closely related to $\\color{blue}{k=t-c}$! ! ! ! We take advantage of this to perform high-order difference estimation. ** We are in the same group (for example, we select the middle-aged group $c_1$), and use the data of $y_{c_1,t_2}$ minus $y_{c_1,t_1}$ to carry out the time analysis within the group. The first difference** of: During the life cycle, the time difference of each group of queues is evenly distributed, basically every five years, that is $$ (x_{ci,t+1}-x_{ci,t})=(x_{cj,t+1}-x_{cj,t})=\\Delta x_t $$ So the formula can be transformed as follows: $$ \\begin{align} \u0026y_{c_1,t_2}-y_{c_1,t_1}\\newline \u0026=(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{1}}})(x_{c_1,t_2}- x_{c_1,t_1})+(\\gamma_{t_2}-\\gamma_{t_1})+(\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_2}-\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_1})\\newline \u0026=(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{1}}})\\Delta x_t+(\\gamma_{t_2}-\\gamma_{t_1})+(\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_2}-\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_1})\\newline \\end{align} $$ The corresponding time relationship $k=t-c$, we then perform the first-order difference in time on another same group. We select a group $c_{0}$ that is younger than group $c_{1}$ (regarded as a youth group), and get $k_2=t_1-c_0,k_3=t_2-c_0$. At this point the first difference is obtained: $$ \\begin{align} \u0026y_{c_0,t_2}-y_{c_0,t_1}\\newline \u0026=(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{3}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}})\\Delta x_t+(\\gamma_{t_1+1}-\\gamma_{t_1})+(\\varepsilon_{c_0,t_2}-\\varepsilon_{c_0,t_1})\\newline \\end{align} $$ At this time, we subtract the first-order differences of $c_1$ and $c_0$ the two sets of time: $$ \\begin{align} \u0026[y_{c_1,t_2}-y_{c_1,t_1}]-[y_{c_0,t_2}-y_{c_0,t_1}]\\newline \u0026=(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{1}}})\\Delta x_t+(\\gamma_{t_1+1}-\\gamma_{t_1})+(\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_2}-\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_1})\\newline \u0026-(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{3}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}})\\Delta x_t-(\\gamma_{t_1+1}-\\gamma_{t_1})-(\\varepsilon_{c_0,t_2}-\\varepsilon_{c_0,t_1})\\newline \u0026=[(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{1}}})-(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{3}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}})]\\Delta x_t-\\Delta_{c}\\Delta_{t}\\varepsilon_{c_{0},t_{2}} \\end{align} $$ We can find that this high-order difference does not contain time effect $\\gamma_t$ and queue effect $\\chi_c$ at this time. $[(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{j}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{j-1}}})-(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{ j+2}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{j}}})]$ also has geom","date":"2024-01-19","objectID":"/en/posts/hlt/:3:1","tags":["Literature Review","Stata"],"title":"HLT: Lifecycle and Wage Decomposition","uri":"/en/posts/hlt/"},{"categories":["Economic Study"],"content":"HLT Full name heckman-lochner-taber. The introduction here mainly refers to the appendix of ““golden ages”: A tale of the labor markets in China and the united states” (Hanming et al., 2023) 8. The original text can be found in “Life cycle wage growth across countries” (Lagakos et al., 2018) The previous equation estimate decomposes the wage contribution into: work experience, cohort, age, and education. This is what leads to collinearity, but this decomposition is not permanent. If we look at people’s wage growth from a life cycle perspective, we can put forward a hypothesis: **When a person is about to retire, he will give up any human capital investment. At this time, the source of his wage growth is only the time effect. **At this time, in the two cohorts, within the same $t$ year period, the wage growth rate of the elderly group is 1%; the growth rate of the youth group is 5%, which means that 1% is contributed by the time effect, and 4% is Queue effect + work experience. Then we can study whether the time effect of each group tends to be consistent in old age by continuously adjusting the income effect.

STATA data generation is as follows: clear input str6 gender income coffee \"woman\" 8 1 \"woman\" 9 2 \"woman\" 10 3 \"woman\" 11 4 \"man\" 1 6 \"man\" 2 7 \"man\" 3 8 \"man\" 4 9 end We can then plot a scatter plot and perform three different sample fits: one for the overall data, one for men, and one for women.

However, if we perform separate regressions for men and women, the conclusion is the opposite—higher income leads to higher coffee consumption. Clearly, the latter aligns more with reality. This is $\\boxed{Simpson’s Paradox}$: local correlations and overall correlations can present completely different results. Simpson’s Paradox is ubiquitous in life, such as measuring the efficacy of drugs across different age groups, gender discrimination in college admissions, or racial bias in police enforcement. We should not only care about absolute values, such as the gender ratio of a certain outcome; But also observe relative values, such as whether police focus more on people of color because they have higher crime rates; 《An alternative test of racial prejudice in motor vehicle searches: Theory and evidence》（2006）1 is based on “crime rates by race and police enforcement focus” to study racial bias in police enforcement in Florida. Since Floyd’s “I can’t breathe” went viral, many books have used this event to introduce counterfactual inference2 (e.g., Mostly Harmless Econometrics by Joshua D. Angrist). We should also pay attention to internal stratification, such as by race, region, gender… as in the coffee consumption example above. One reason for Simpson’s Paradox is omitted variables and confounders3—in the case of coffee consumption and income, gender is an important factor we omitted, but by grouping and fitting, we controlled for it. Other similar paradoxes include survivorship bias and Berkson’s Paradox… both involve unintentional sample selection that affects analysis results.

Residuals: Economic, Mathematical, and Statistical Meanings The ordinary regression equation OLS is: $$ Y=\\alpha X +u $$ This directly fits the overall data. Knowing Simpson’s Paradox, we understand that such regression is an overall fit and may yield completely different results from local fits. The residual $ \\color{red}{u} $ omits too much information we haven’t considered, such as gender classification. Therefore, we need to group the data and decompose the gender variable M from the residual $\\color{red}{u}$. $$ Y=\\alpha X +\\beta M+u $$ Here, we introduce $\\boxed{control variables}$. Note! This is my personal perspective on control variables from a grouping viewpoint, emphasizing their role in selection bias. This grouping requires careful consideration of the practical economic significance of control variables in our study. For example, numerous studies show that coffee consumption habits indeed differ by gender. The selection of control variables also serves to reduce confounding factors; additionally, we must consider optimal fitting, unbiased estimation, and other statistical mathematical meanings. With panel data, our equation becomes two-dimensional, with object/space coding i and time coding t. The ordinary regression equation OLS becomes: $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}=\\alpha X_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\beta M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+u_{_{\\color{red}{it}}} $$ To further decompose the economic interpretation of residuals across time and space/object dimensions, we continue to decompose: $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}=\\alpha X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\beta M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\lambda_{\\color{red}{i}}+\\gamma_{\\color{red}{t}}+u^{\\prime } $$ Thus, the equation becomes: $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}=\\alpha X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\beta M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\lambda_{\\color{red}{i}}+\\gamma_{\\color{red}{t}}+u^{\\prime } $$ First, let’s analyze their economic meaning—variables: $\\boxed{\\gamma_{\\color{red}{t}}}:$ This part of the residual is the decomposition of the time dimension, indicating that this variation is only related to time, representing time effects. For example, seasonal vegetable yields are clearly related to seasons, and technology naturally progresses steadily over the long term. These effects are shared by all individuals, meaning all samples change synchronously over time. $\\boxed{\\lambda_{\\color{red}{i}}}:$ This part of the residual is the decomposition of the space/object dimension, indicating that this variation is only related to the individual, representing individual effects. For example, Apple took a long time to adopt USB-C, which is part of their corporate culture. Only Apple had this idea, and for a long time, they were the only company in their industry to insist on this. $\\boxed{u_{\\color{red}{it}}^{\\prime }}:$ The deviation between the actual value and the estimated value, outside our model’s explanation, is the residual. Causes include measurement errors, omitted variables, and models not aligning with reality… Next, let’s analyze their mathematical meaning—intercepts: $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}=\\alpha X_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\beta D_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+(\\lambda_{\\color{red}{i}}+\\gamma_{\\color{red}{t}}+u^{\\prime }) $$ Clearly, $(\\lambda_{\\color{red}{i}}+\\gamma_{\\color{red}{t}}+u^{\\prime })$ as a constant is the intercept in the linear equation structure! Finally, let’s analyze their statistical meaning—residuals: Whether there are different intercepts is closely related to the distribution of residuals, heteroscedasticity, and correlation. Fixed effects, random effects, and pooled regressions differ in how they decompose residuals, determining whether our model can explain individual and time effects. $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}=\\alpha X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\beta M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+(\\lambda_{\\color{red}{i}}+\\gamma_{\\color{red}{t}}+u^{\\prime }) \\newline \\xrightarrow{Decomposition} Explainable part + \\color{blue}{Unexplainable part} (error) $$ First, here’s a summary chart, followed by an explanation.

This can be seen as all data points sharing a single intercept. Here, we assume no individual effects: $\\lambda_{\\color{red}{i}}=0$. We also assume that the remaining residuals are uncorrelated with explanatory and control variables: $Cov（u|M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}},X_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}） =0$, and the residuals follow a normal distribution. $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}=\\alpha X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\beta M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+u $$ Pooled OLS uses the least squares method to perform an overall regression on all points, with all data points sharing a single intercept u4.

Fixed Effects Divided into individual fixed effects and time fixed effects (double fixed). Individual Fixed Effects: $\\boxed{LSDV} :$ Pooled OLS treats all $\\lambda_{it}$ equally. Imagine observing the same person multiple times—pooled OLS treats each repeated observation as equally valuable. Fixed effects disagree, believing that individuals have certain traits, and repeated observations provide limited value. Therefore, we need to generate dummy individual variables (n-1) to identify each individual and estimate each individual’s effect separately, known as the “Least Square Dummy Variable Model” (LSDV). This generates many control variables, so $R^2$ is high. $$ \\begin{align} Y_{\\color{red}{it}}\u0026=\\alpha X_{\\color{red}{it}}+\\beta M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\alpha_{1}D_{1}+\\alpha_{2}D_{2}+\\cdots+\\alpha_{N}D_{N}+u_{\\color{red}{it}}\\newline \\end{align} $$ Individual effects—causal relationship diagram. Treating individual effects as confounders, we control for them to truncate. $\\boxed{Within-group estimation}$, fixed effects assume that individual effects are correlated with explanatory variables, so we use within-group deviation to eliminate this correlation, similar to de-meaning—subtracting the within-group mean5. The average is taken for the same variable, averaging values across different years: $\\bar X_i = \\frac{\\sum_{t=n}^{t=1}{X_{it}}}{t}$ Supplement Variance analysis of panel data. After setting xtset id year, id could be a spatial, industry, or individual identifier, giving us n groups. Each group has internal variance, which is within-group variance; there is also variance between groups, which is between-group variance. Variance analysis helps confirm whether our grouping is appropriate. Here, within-group estimation is used, which is more effective than between-group estimation. The argument is from Wooldridge’s econometrics textbook exercises and won’t be expanded here. $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}-\\bar Y_{\\color{red}{i}}=\\alpha (X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}-\\bar X _{\\color{red}{i}})+\\beta (M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}-\\bar M _{\\color{red}{i}})+(u_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}-\\bar u _{\\color{red}{i}}) $$ This equation can also be understood as the lagged $\\boxed{first-difference method}$. $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}-\\bar Y_{\\color{red}{i}}=Y_{\\color{red}{i,t}}-Y_{\\color{red}{i,t-1}} =\\alpha (X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}-X _{\\color{red}{i,t-1}})+\\beta (M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}- M _{\\color{red}{i,t-1}})+(u_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}- u _{\\color{red}{i,t-1}}) $$ In summary, there are currently three estimation equations for individual fixed effects: dummy variable least squares, within-group estimation, and first-difference. Their estimates are largely consistent, with differences mainly in data assumptions. First-difference eliminates individual effects, so it cannot estimate effects that do not change over time. Dummy least squares (LSDV) requires that the constructed dummy variables be strictly exogenous, and too many dummy variables may exceed STATA’s operational limits. $$ \\begin{cases} Y_{\\color{red}{it}}=\\alpha X_{\\color{red}{it}}+\\beta M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\sum_{1}^{N}{\\alpha_{j}D_{j}}+u_{\\color{red}{it}}\\newline Y_{\\color{red}{it}}-\\bar Y_{\\color{red}{i}}=\\alpha (X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}-\\bar X _{\\color{red}{i}})+\\beta (M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}-\\bar M _{\\color{red}{i}})+(u_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}-\\bar u _{\\color{red}{i}})\\newline Y_{\\color{red}{i,t}}-Y_{\\color{red}{i,t-1}} =\\alpha (X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}-X _{\\color{red}{i,t-1}})+\\beta (M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}- M _{\\color{red}{i,t-1}})+(u_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}- u _{\\color{red}{i,t-1}}) \\end{cases} $$ The goal is to correctly estimate the coefficient $\\alpha$ of the explained variable when individual effects are correlated with control variables, and the parameters $ \\alpha $ in the above four estimation equations are the same: $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}=\\alpha X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\beta M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\lambda_{\\color{red}{i}}+\\color{blue}{(\\gamma_{\\color{red}{t}}+u^{\\prime })}\\ $$ ","date":"2023-12-26","objectID":"/en/posts/ji_sata/:3:2","tags":["Causal Effects","Stata"],"title":"Grouping and Measurement of Econometric Data (STATA Version)","uri":"/en/posts/ji_sata/"},{"categories":["Software Tools","Economic Studies"],"content":"*Supplement: Frisch-Waugh-Lovell Theorem The lemma proving that dummy variable least squares and within-group estimation have the same coefficient $\\alpha$ is the “Frisch-Waugh-Lovell Theorem.” Here’s a minimal example: The real equation is: $$ Y=\\beta_1 X_1+ \\beta_2 X_2 +u_1 $$ We want to estimate $\\beta_1$, but we omitted variable $X_1$ and only regressed $X_2$, resulting in: $$ Y=\\alpha X_2+u_2 $$ Now, we regress $X_2$ and $X_1$ to get: $$ X_1=\\gamma X_2+u_3 $$ Finally, we regress the residuals: $$ u_2=\\dot \\beta u_3+u $$ Based on the residuals from the two regressions, we get: $$ \\begin{cases} u_2=Y-\\alpha X_2\\newline u_3 = X_1 - \\gamma X_2 \\end{cases} $$ Expanding and transforming, we directly obtain: $$ Y=\\dot \\beta X_1 + (\\alpha-\\gamma)X_2+u $$ We find that $\\dot \\beta=\\beta_1$, and through this indirect estimation, we estimate the desired coefficient $\\beta_1$.

Personally, I believe[^7] it’s due to different residual calculation methods across commands. (1) Pooled OLS calculates residuals for one regression equation and all points. (2) (3) (4) Cluster many regression equations with the same coefficients but different intercepts, and each point calculates variance with its corresponding regression equation, then sums them up. Why are $R^2$ different: (1) (3) (4) All use LSDV, so many dummy variables are generated. (2) Uses between-group estimation, so no dummy variables are generated.

The Gray Area of Mechanism Testing in Empirical Studies Simpson’s Paradox teaches us that grouped regression and overall regression can yield completely different results, partly due to omitted variables. Therefore, we need to add control variables. When using “panel data,” the data includes “time” and “space” dimensions, which can still affect our research. Thus, we need to separate “individual effects” and “time effects.” Answering Simpson’s Paradox—here, we address causality, requiring avoidance of endogeneity. In mechanism testing, some use grouped regression or interaction terms to extend conclusions, assuming—the new variable in mechanism testing is not an omitted control variable. There’s a big problem here—how do you ensure there’s no endogeneity in mechanism testing? For example, in the figure below, the leftmost path is a collision path in causality, while the right side shows moderating and mediating effects in mechanism testing. Clearly, collision effects with confounders can still satisfy moderating and mediating effects. This introduces a new endogeneity issue!!!! Therefore, Zhu Jiaxiang and Zhang Wenrui (2021)[^8] state that moderating effects do not satisfy statistical causality testing. On this basis, Jiang Ting (2022)[^9] even calls for abandoning the three-step mediation method, as it’s meaningless—it neither proves nor disproves endogeneity. Thus, our mechanism testing is left with only two options: 1. Further prove no endogeneity. This requires another controlled experiment (feels like another mini economic empirical comparison); or discuss the correlation between residuals and the explained variable after grouped regression. Use correlation + theoretical explanation to approach causality. 《Causal Inference in Empirical Research: Mediation and Moderation Effects》Jiang Ting (2022)\r2. No need to prove, my variable is naturally exogenous. The variable has no endogeneity in practical terms, meaning more theoretical and economic explanations are needed. The most common “filler” in domestic research is the four major regions and the Hu Line, as these classifications are naturally exogenous variables in practical terms. It seems that mechanism testing is essentially an incomplete mini-empirical study, extending conclusions through incomplete empirical steps. Personally, I feel that no econometrics textbook emphasizes so-called “mechanism analysis,” but it has become a specific requirement domestically. It seems that quantitative economics ultimately relies on a mix of practical theory and quantitative analysis.

Mediation Effects: Differences from Psychological Statistics The views on mediation effects mainly reference The Book of Why by Judea Pearl. When we ask why, there are two types of logical chains: one is principle, and the other is process. $$ Eating oranges\\rightarrow Vitamin C\\rightarrow Resisting scurvy\\newline Elderly\\rightarrow Falling\\rightarrow Hospitalization\\ $$ Taking the above two path diagrams as examples, the first one—eating vitamin C to resist scurvy—sounds more like a principle-based answer, while the elderly falling seems more like a process. I’ve seen many forums and social science自媒体 videos claiming that “economics stole mediation effects from psychology”—this is not the case. Psychology can widely apply mediation effects because its path diagrams are: $external stimuli\\rightarrow human reactions, hormonal changes\\rightarrow behavioral changes$, which align more with principles. Economics, on the other hand, answers with $variable1\\rightarrow variable2\\rightarrow variable3$, which is more like a process description, broader, and less aligned with principles, hence the skepticism. Psychology restricts mediation variables to human performance, while economics has no such strict restrictions, making spurious correlations highly likely. For example, in the case of vitamin C and scurvy, people long believed it was “fruit—oranges” that mattered. The Kost Arctic expedition thought the key was fresh fruit, so they prepared no fruit but only fresh meat, and everyone ended up with scurvy. To address “Simpson’s Paradox,” we still need mediation effects because of the $\\boxed{mediation fallacy}$. Take the Science paper Sex Bias in Graduate Admissions: Data from Berkeley[^10] as an example. We get the following causal path diagram. Gender affects admission rates through two paths. 《Sex Bias in Graduate Admissions: Data from Berkeley》\rDirect effect: $gender\\rightarrow admission rate$ Indirect effect: $gender\\rightarrow department\\rightarrow admission rate$, where “department” is the mediating variable. If we directly control for “department,” we show the direct effect of gender on admission rates, and the regression will indicate discrimination against women. If we only control for “state of residence,” we show the direct effect of gender on admission rates and the indirect effect of gender-department-admission rates, indicating no discrimination against women. The completely different results are precisely Simpson’s Paradox . In the coffee example, we made a mistake by omitting a variable; here, the mistake is controlling for a “mediating variable”. The final conclusion is that because women are more likely to apply to the most competitive departments, their admission rates appear lower, so department is an important mediating variable and should not be casually controlled. Thus, mediating variables should not be used as control variables, and if we want to distinguish between direct and mediating effects, further differentiation is needed.

Moderating Effects: Grouped Regression or Interaction Terms Found a comprehensive summary This section mainly references Regression Analysis by Xie Yu. For variables $Y$, $X_1$, $X_2$, and $D$, we have different estimation strategies. Grouped regression: $Y=\\beta_1 X_1+\\beta_2 X_2+u$, then group by D. Introduce interaction terms, with two estimation methods: $$ \\begin{cases} Y=\\beta_1 X_1+\\beta_2 X_2+\\beta_3D+\\beta_4 DX_1+u \\newline Y=\\beta_1 X_1+\\beta_2 X_2+\\beta_3DX +u \\end{cases} $$ What's the difference between interaction terms and grouped regression? Generally, interaction terms emphasize moderating effects, while grouped regression emphasizes heterogeneity. Jiang Ting (2022) believes they are the same. However, there are still some differences: First, there are cases where grouped regression is necessary, such as when discussing regional heterogeneity across east, west, north, south, and central regions. We cannot quantify their roles in interaction terms with 1-4, and repeatedly using 0-1 coding doesn’t align with control logic, so grouped regression is needed. Second, there are cases where we need to study interaction terms, i.e., substitution and complementary effects. When the equation becomes $Y=\\beta_1 X_1+\\beta_2 X_2+\\beta_3DX +u$, studying marginal effects, each other’s marginal effects are influenced by the other. Finally, when group coefficients are similar, grouped regression can also serve as a robustness test. Here are some common conclusions (though I feel these conclusions lack authoritative paper support): Statistical testing favors interaction terms because they have significance tests (though now grouped regression can also test coefficient differences for significance), are more sensitive, and use the entire sample, while grouped regression reduces sample size; Data assumptions differ, interaction terms assume only interaction-related groups have between-group differences, requiring stricter assumptions. Interaction terms require control variable coefficients to be consistent across groups, while grouped regression does not. An extended conclusion—when a variable interacts with all control variables, interaction term estimation and grouped regression are completely consistent. Different variables require different discussions; interaction terms can be divided into dummy-dummy interactions (recommended reference), dummy-continuous interactions, and continuous-continuous interactions, requiring specific analysis. (Basic Econometrics by Gujarati supports dummy-dummy interactions—no controversy given the prevalence of difference-in-differences.) Interaction term assumptions remain a gray area in mechanism testing. As long as your variable logic makes sense, use whichever is significant—grouped or interaction—or better yet, use both. What kind of variables are suitable for interactions? From a mathematical perspective, addition affects intercepts, while multiplication affects slopes. From the figure, moderating effects emphasize interactions because they affect slopes along with X.\rFrom the figure, moderating effects emphasize interactions because they affect slopes along with X. Grouped regression emphasizes that X’s slope is the same, only intercepts differ, with no moderating effects, making it more suitable as a control variable. Can we delete lower-order terms? Which of the following two estimation equations should we choose? Can we remove the lower-order terms $X$ and $D$ after including the interaction term $XD$? $$ \\begin{cases} Y=\\beta_1 X_1+\\beta_2 X_2+\\beta_3 D+\\beta_4 DX_1+u\\newline Y=\\beta_1 X_1+\\beta_2 X_2+\\beta_3DX_2 +u\\end{cases} $$ The answer is that $\\beta_3 D$ should be included. In the first equation, $\\beta_4$ is indeed the net effect after controlling for $X_1$ and $D$. This can lead to “multicollinearity,” which can be addressed by de-meaning (subtracting the mean).

All such behaviors, imbued with artificial attributes, carry the taint of bandwagoning. Then there are traits that only manifest in social interactions—“checking in to show focused study, emphasizing one’s soaring enthusiasm for learning” or “claiming to love xx genre of books, yet never discussing any specific insights gained.” “It’s not so much loving a certain thing as loving the self that yearns for that thing”—in reality, they enjoy the state of being fanatical; toward what that fanaticism is directed becomes irrelevant. Conversely, the “genuine” is a pure, natural attribute, requiring no deliberate human effort to maintain or display.

That’s why I hate kind-hearted girls. In the duration of maintaining passion: The genuine is enduring, loyal, and scarce; even after a long separation, mutual understanding persists—it is unique and irreplaceable. The counterfeit is transient, requiring constant, deliberate human effort to maintain; it fears being replaced by others and can itself be replaced. For instance, in Rascal Does Not Dream, the protagonist stands against social atmosphere, believing that such atmosphere amounts to nothing before precious people. From now on, my enemy is the atmosphere. Echoing what others say is effortless; judging right and wrong entirely by one’s own will burns calories. Bearing one’s own judgment, when met with denial, inflicts pain. In the motivation of inner expression: The genuine is pure, natural, a feeling springing spontaneously from the depths of the heart; the counterfeit is impure in motive, harboring other utilitarian purposes. The debate over “what is human nature at birth” can be considered a discussion of the genuine. In narrative construction: The genuine and the counterfeit reflect one another in pairs, and contradictions exist within them. Perhaps one believes that friendship requires accommodation, so the author writes that true friends can quarrel; one believes that the species distinction between humans and demons is their essence, yet the author states that goodness of character is the more important measure; some believe that朋友圈 (social media posts) prove happiness and joy that begs sharing, yet the author writes that the contented do not proclaim their satisfaction to the outside world. In character portrayal, counterfeit and genuine are often intertwined with “self-awareness,” “envy,” “disgust,” and “inferiority.” Japanese anime displays such adeptness in this regard, inseparable from their early creation of campus youth anime—these emotions are the normative state of adolescent students. If a person is self-aware (feels that they) can distinguish between “counterfeit” and “genuine,” such characters often feel inferior for being counterfeit. For example, in Oshi no Ko, in the early stages, Ai Hoshino dares not express “love” to her children—she is unwilling to falsely speak loving words to them. Oshi no Ko\rFrom this perspective, it is evident that most authors write characters who consider themselves “counterfeit” with a sympathetic attitude. Considering oneself counterfeit has a premise: having never attained the “genuine” while yearning for it, at which point they are self-aware, self-aware of their ability to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit. The pain of yearning without attainment, and a past devoid of happiness, can both become sources of counterfeit inferiority, and also the entry point for sympathetic perspective. Manga Oshi no Ko\rIf a person is recognized as “genuine” or “counterfeit” and lacks self-awareness, then they will be despised or envied by others.

Pursuing “non-artificial purity” in such works is regarded as human nature. The pain lies in “the fair maiden, sought but not obtained.” The genuine is either god-made or human heart-made, meaning that as long as human interaction is involved, the genuine is impossible. Past philosophers pursued “objectivity,” yet regrettably, philosophy has only subjectivity-objectivity, not objectivity-objectivity, because it is humans observing, humans interacting. Then, where lies the sought non-artificial, absolute objectivity? Philosophy’s answer is utilitarianism or dialectics. The common answer in anime and manga works is this—like drawing a circle according to an ideal. Reality cannot have a perfect circle. Teacher Luo Xiang seems to greatly enjoy this metaphor—there is never perfect justice, just as there is never a perfect circle. What has always been worth praising in humans is not the magnificent feat of drawing the circle, but the human heart that creates the ideal circle, as well as the eternally maintained posture of pursuit—infinitely approaching the genuine amidst futility, like the rolling stone borne by Sisyphus—that is the genuine of brief life. For example, in Hyouka, from the “Jumonji Incident” to numerous sports anime (Run with the Wind, Haikyuu!!, Slam Dunk, SK8 the Infinity, Ping Pong: The Animation, etc.), a genius embracing the genuine without awareness is pursued by an inferiority-stricken bosom friend. Powerlessness and inferiority simultaneously strike the “self-aware counterfeit” character. In Ping Pong: The Animation, Chinese player “Kong” is eliminated and comes to Japan, filled with resentment, then is defeated by a Japanese player. The airplane scene symbolizes that the wish to defeat Japan and return home is blocked. Later, he accepts everything and trains with the Japanese player to improve himself. The final method of resolution is also cliché—binding the relationship of the two into one, or that love transcends all. Suppressing utilitarian competition, understanding that what matters most is the attitude of mutual pursuit—there is no counterfeit and no genuine, only genuine heart exchanged for genuine heart. When SK8 the Infinity came out, I expected it to offer new insights on “effort and unsurpassable talent,” but it still gave the same formulaic answer—love is greater than everything. Real athletic competition is far more ruthless; in this regard, Ping Pong: The Animation portrays it more authentically.

Conversely, the genuine may not fail to become counterfeit. “When false becomes true, true also becomes false; when true becomes false, false also becomes true.” Japan also has a famous concept called “twilight.” At twilight, the sun sets, day and night interweave, and the boundary between false and real blurs, overlapping together—Labyrinth of Magic. Mahua FunAge’s Too Cool to Kill is a remake of Labyrinth of Magic. In Your Name, Mitsuha and Taki meet across displaced time and space also at twilight, and the BGM is also called Twilight. The “Monogatari Series” directly and vividly demonstrates both types. In Nisemonogatari, Koyomi Araragi genuinely treats the counterfeit Karen as his sister—whether genuine or not has already become irrelevant. There are many similar concepts in Buddhism, broadly speaking, “phenomena arise from the mind.” Once there was a famous reading comprehension passage “Again the Year When Zongzi Fragrance Floats”, in which the author ate everywhere to find the taste of his mother’s zongzi, but in the end, the more he compared, the less he found it. The question asks: did he find it in the end? The answer is yes: because the taste of his mother’s zongzi became clearer in the contrast of memories. (This is Chinese reading comprehension! I gradually understand everything) In Kizumonogatari, it is the genuine becoming counterfeit. Nadeko Sengoku cannot obtain Araragi Koyomi’s love, and in grief and indignation, becomes a god. Fraud master and logical genius Kaiki Deishu uses “talk therapy” (talking no jutsu), making Sengoku pretend to be deceived and give up romantic feelings—“there is no irreplaceable love in this world; if he doesn’t love you, find another.” Kaiki’s counterfeit logic: there is no irreplaceable genuine in this world, only counterfeits, because everything can be replaced. Therefore, the so-called unattainable genuine is actually irrelevant; cherishing oneself is most important. (Kaiki is a fraud master; he defrauded Sengoku and also defrauded himself—in the work, he too pursues the genuine) Below is an example of counterfeit becoming genuine. It is mainly a false shell plus sincere emotion. Sincerity is number one. For instance, Emiya Shirou’s counterfeit overpowering the King’s Treasury. Whether in The Unpromised Garden of Words or Fate/stay night, Emiya’s overpowering of the King’s Treasury is because he protects important people with counterfeits—this is a sincerity that enemies who merely attack with genuine items lack. In The Unpromised Garden of Words and Fate/stay night, Emiya Shirou battles the King’s Treasury through reproductions; here is my favorite excerpt from The Unpromised Garden of Words. In Oregairu, even in the middle-to-late stages, Hachiman refers to his relationship with Yukino as “parasitic,” but after mutual confession of feelings, I believe he attains the genuine. Even more famous is the plot of Nisekoi—the classic “girl who falls from the sky” versus childhood friend, where the initial true love is forcibly isolated by the author’s “hand of plot,” and the bickering couple unknowingly become unable to leave each other, while the childhood friend Onodera becomes the queen of “loser dogs” voiced by Hikasa Yō. (I am very dissatisfied with such handling! I can only say that triangular relationships are most prone to blowing up. The Silent Pavilion, Stealing Star September Sky, Work! Demon Lord! have all blown up—let’s see whether Conan can safely emerge) Gradually默契的 bickering couple in Nisekoi\rSaekano: How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend is also typical—Megumi always buries her emotions deep in her heart; though she is the heroine, the setting is that of a “background character” making a comeback. In such works, the protagonist often feels inferior for being counterfeit.

At the same time, the mathematics we learn now is not truly abstract mathematics in the genuine sense; we are far from witnessing genuine mathematics. This current idea of liking偏, difficult, strange college entrance exam problems is merely a form of adolescent中二. Perhaps the teacher has long forgotten this matter, but I have constantly reflected on this mindset. From the perspective of the college entrance exam system, finding the rhythm and method that suits oneself is another discussion; the teacher undoubtedly meant well for us. However, what I want to contemplate is: what is “love for a subject”? In fact, the distinction between genuine and counterfeit is a standard. Yet, in reality, using “motive” as a standard for judgment does not accord with reality, so I remain an exalter of the counterfeit. As Stove-side Night Talk says, “All evils begin with lust; judge by deeds, not by heart; judge by heart, and there are few perfect people in this world”—this is roughly the principle being spoken of. In the end, the distinction between genuine and counterfeit is whether humans consciously identify or even negate the “artificial” side, to pursue beautiful ideals that are closer to nature, eternal, and irreplaceable. This process is painful, relative, and memories of failure or success will be etched in one’s bones and heart. I used to scoff at such meaningless subjective judgments, but now I feel they can be accepted. In an era where everyone upholds “it doesn’t matter” and numbness, finding something to pour one’s passion into is painful self-mutilation, but it can also become a ladder toward greatness. Using the一贯 “affectation” of Japanese anime—artificially creating pain, transcending pain, then living with self-righteous arrogance. Or in Japanese anime sentence structure—in the end, humans are just such creatures, living waveringly, awkward, inferior yet arrogant. Although I have summarized numerous standards from anime and manga works, reality is, after all, not anime or literary works—artificiality, duration, and natural purity are actually unimportant, as long as they aid one’s development and can enrich the inner heart—what does it matter if I deceive myself? What does it matter if passion is brief? The authenticity of emotion comes entirely from the human heart. Whether negating the genuine and exalting the counterfeit; or obstinately pursuing the genuine, in the end it is merely a choice. Sincere heart is the standard of judgment in traditional works, but reality is far more complex. In short! Promote existentialism and anthropocentrism! Offer a sincere heart, obtain what one desires—what harm is there?

The articles on Sinology, science, and logic have once again enlightened me. Reflecting now, I’ve always tried to avoid describing my initial motivation for studying economics with the term “serving the world and benefiting the people,” and this influence stems from Wang Xiaobo. Many people would question, what’s the use of so many social science papers? Economics studies money for the implementation of monetary policy, finance is for making money. Even people often say, “I study economics to serve the world and benefit the people, to support the nation.” Many people frequently claim that the liberal arts are disciplines that “continue the learning of past sages and bring peace for generations.” In reality, whether for personal survival or social prosperity, these reasons are all commendable. However, when we add “uniqueness” to this logic, it leads to another meaning: the discipline implies responsibility, and this responsibility is implemented at specific points of action. So, if there is a problem that has no practical use, should we not study it? If you ask someone if studying black holes is useful, he can’t explain it clearly, but everyone already feels that the mysterious natural sciences will eventually be useful in the future. The social sciences can also answer in this way. But this reason is something I am very dissatisfied with, because the underlying motive is still “because this discipline may be useful in the future, so we need to persist,” which is essentially “serving the world and benefiting the people,” “pragmatism,” and the “usefulness above all” mindset. I believe that whether it’s social science or natural science, what truly motivates us to learn is a common cause, not pragmatism or utilitarianism, but the human ideals celebrated in literary works—why climb a mountain, because it is there. For example, Liu Cixin’s “Seeking the Truth,” “The Climbers,” Hemingway’s “The Old Man and the Sea”… The Chinese saying “when choosing between two harms, take the lesser one,” but there are always those who make choices that transcend purely utilitarian considerations. As a science fiction fan, my stance is only one: research is for solving problems, solving problems is for answering questions. We propose many questions based on practical considerations and then solve them, but some questions exist regardless of their practical implications, so we attempt to answer them. Therefore, there’s no need for any reason to study a problem; you just want to know the answer, to delve into the problem, without needing to invoke grand principles or the hardships of life, just because of two words—curiosity is enough. Therefore, Wang Xiaobo opposes certain behaviors that excessively beautify “Sinology,” opposes Confucius and Mencius, and admires Russell. One of the Two Chengs said that “benevolence and love” are like a newborn, fluffy duckling, and many people are so captivated by this mysterious realm that they can’t extricate themselves. So, do we really need to reexperience benevolence and love from the down of a duckling? Many people say that the “I Ching” stands at the pinnacle of predictive analytics, so they no longer pursue answers. All these are about seeking usefulness, wanting to achieve useful goals through mysterious, unfathomable means, regardless of whether there is a process, as long as it’s good , correct, and the inherited mysteriousness is deemed sufficient. I used to not understand why the phrase “because the mountain is there” is often mentioned, but now I realize it’s because this phrase encapsulates this truth—the pursuit of answers doesn’t need a reason. That is also what Wang Xiaobo said: one day when I’m no longer here, but as long as I think that there will still be people walking on this path seeking truth, I will feel happy.

Is there anything greater than hardship in the world of Cthulhu? Unknowable, unseen, incomprehensible, unstoppable. When the absurd logic descends upon the flesh, the transcendent hardships of the era become like a cold and stern mountain. Mazhe attempted to untangle the ripples of fate, believing that reason was the driving force behind the essence of these murders. But what if the murders originated from chaos and disorder themselves? Thus, the looming behemoth behind the tangle of yarn overwhelmed him, and we were horrified to discover that the error lay in our self-assumption that “life contains no errors beyond reason”; the error lay in our refusal to acknowledge that life indeed harbors a corner of “disorder and chaos”. Why do we criticize Erjiu for not handling internal conflicts well in “In the Heat of the Sun,” but “To Live,” “Brothers,” “My Life as Emperor,” and “The Seventh Day” do not elicit the same backlash? As absurd films, I am inclined to believe that “He bian de cuo wu” surpasses “Yu zhou tan suo bian ji bu” in terms of its thematic depth. Like Erjiu’s ending, the latter also finds solace and inspiration from survivors, empathizing with them as they await the arrival of spring after enduring hardship. Hence, people extol phrases like “the good days are still ahead” and “there is no winter that cannot be crossed,” because we are destined to overcome, and therefore, we face the future without fear. This is evidently a circular argument. But outside of this cycle, who will question the winter? Yu Hua’s works confront the source of suffering directly—a Cthulhu without an object to speak of. Yu zhou tan suo bian ji bu\r“The Mistake by the River”? Where exactly does the mistake lie? On a concrete level, Ma Zhe refuses to acknowledge the randomness of the madman’s killings, thus deviating from the truth from the outset. This exposes the villagers’ reality of not being accepted by society: Ma Zhe does not believe that the madman would commit murder, so he indirectly uncovers the taboo love affairs after poetry creation, the secret cross-dressing after unjust cases, and the perverse motives behind kind adoption. The more Ma Zhe denies madness, the more madness he uncovers. As a police officer, Ma Zhe’s pursuit of truth and adherence to logic seemed unquestionable, yet it led to greater pain and death. Ma Zhe believed in the logic of life, but the reality of this logic crushed him and his world. His clues only led from one person’s madness to another’s. A person who refused to acknowledge the rationality of madness ended up surrounded by it, and eventually succumbed to madness himself. This was the mistake he made. From an abstract perspective, what is madness? It is suffering, akin to good people not receiving their due rewards, efforts not being reciprocated, and people seeking pain amidst happiness. It is the kind-hearted family giving birth to a disabled child. Ma Zhe refused to believe that the madman was the murderer, just as he refused to believe that his own child could become a madman. When Ma Zhe finally accepted the reality that the madman was the culprit, he had to raise his own child, who had become mad. The river is the bond of fate. Xu Liang from the Director’s Cut runs by the river, the old lady dies by the river, the poet-teacher dies by the river, the child dies by the river. They bury their secrets by the riverside. “Madman, murder case, riverside, rain curtain, life” are strung together in a strange, low-probability manner. The audience may question how such low-probability events could be coincidental; there must be the hand of a double destiny! We try to understand fate, but in the end, we are trapped by fate.

In the limit of a function (page 33, Volume I), the function converges, denoted as $\\small \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}{f(x_n)}=\\lim_{n \\rightarrow x_0}{f(x)}$.

Probability Theory: Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem What you think of as “chance” is often embedded in “necessity.” Someone necessarily wins the lottery; it’s just that person chance is you. Reference: Mao Shisong’s “Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics”2, sequences of random variables have two modes of convergence: convergence in probability and convergence in distribution. Convergence in Probability: $\\bbox[#def,5px,border: 1px solid]{ x\\stackrel{P}{\\longrightarrow}c }$ For example, when flipping a coin, the initial frequency of heads may deviate greatly from $\\frac{1}{2}$, but as the number of flips increases, the frequency approaches the probability. Frequency statistics have become one of the methods to determine probability3. Various versions of the Law of Large Numbers, $\\boxed{ Law of Large Numbers }$ essentially say the same thing: as the number of experiments $n$ increases, the probability of the deviation $\\small \\frac{S_n}{n}-P$ being greater than a predetermined value $\\varepsilon$ decreases. Whether it’s the Bernoulli (Bernoulli) Law of Large Numbers, Chebyshev’s Law of Large Numbers, Markov’s Law of Large Numbers, or Khinchin’s Law of Large Numbers, they all essentially describe the same thing4. Convergence in Distribution: $\\bbox[#def,5px,border: 1px solid]{ x\\stackrel{F}{\\longrightarrow}c }$ Strong convergence in distribution is pointwise convergence, while weak convergence removes discontinuities and only considers the continuous distribution of $F(x)$.

Interesting knowledge about function distributions6 Assume there is a random variable that follows a binomial distribution. When it tends to the limit, with the expectation equal to the variance, it becomes a Poisson distribution. The intervals between random variables follow an exponential distribution. The nth variable corresponds to the gamma distribution in the horizontal coordinate.

Convergence Hypothesis (Convergence) From the资料 used by the teacher in the “Regional Economics” course 《Advanced Economic Geography》 (He Canfei著). With the proposal of the Solow model, development economics researchers raised questions: Since each economy has its own steady state and balanced growth path, and at the same time, less developed economies grow quickly while advanced economies slow down, the question is, will the economic growth of all economies converge in the end? $$ \\begin{cases} \\beta\\text{-convergence} \\begin{cases} \\text{Absolute Convergence} \\ \\text{Conditional Convergence} \\ \\text{Club Convergence} \\end{cases} \\ \\sigma\\text{-convergence} \\end{cases} $$ $\\beta$-convergence: $\\boxed{\\beta\\text{ Absolute Convergence}}$ assumes that regardless of the initial conditions of the economy, due to the faster development of the weaker and slower development of the stronger, the economy will eventually converge to the same level.

Convergence Speed It seems like a mathematical concept from real analysis, but I first learned it in Romer’s “Advanced Macroeconomics,” so I’ve categorized it under economics. I looked it up on Wikipedia (Rate of convergence), which is mainly applied in algorithm optimization and deep learning fields. If a sequence $x_k$ converges to $L$, the expression $\\mu$ is the rate of convergence. $$ \\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\frac{|x_{k+1}-L|}{|x_k-L|^q}=\\mu $$ When $q=1$ in the equation, it is linear convergence, where the convergence speed is the ratio of the numerical difference to the convergence point between times $t$ and $t+1$. Imagine a race. We measure speed by comparing the distance from the starting point. Convergence is like anxiously waiting for the school bell. We care about how long it will take to reach the endpoint.

Econometric Equations (1) Absolute Convergence Barro and Martin (1991)7 proposed the test equation for absolute $\\beta$ convergence based on Baumol (1986)8. $$ \\small \\frac{1}{T}\\left[\\log(y_{i,t+T}) - \\log(y_{i,t})\\right] = \\alpha - \\frac{(1 - e^{-\\beta T})}{T} \\log(y_{i,t}) + \\varepsilon_i $$ Where $i$ represents the $i$th region, $t$ is the initial period, $t+T$ is the final period, $T$ is the length of the observation period, $y_{i,t}$ is the per capita GDP of region $i$ in period $t$, and $\\beta$ represents the convergence speed. If $\\beta \u003e 0$, it indicates that the differences in economic development between regions will gradually disappear, eventually reaching the same steady state. OLS Regression Statistics Chart, Data from EU Regions (Source: Barro and Martin, 1991)\rThe above formula is derived from the neoclassical growth model (i.e., the Solow model). Personally, I find that domestic descriptions of convergence regression variance are much clearer and more concise. Here, I refer to Peng Guohua (2005)9’s regression equation: $$ g = c + \\beta \\ln y_0 + \\varepsilon $$ Where $g$ is the growth rate, $c$ is the constant term, $y_0$ is the actual output, and $\\varepsilon$ is the error term. When $\\beta \u003c 0$, it indicates that the growth rate $g$ is negatively correlated with the economic level $y_0$, consistent with our assumption that “high-level economies grow slower, while low-level economies grow faster.” (2) Conditional Convergence Barro and Martin (1992)10 proposed the test equation for conditional $\\beta$ convergence based on the absolute $\\beta$ convergence test equation: $$ \\small \\frac{1}{T}\\left[\\log(y_{i,t+T}) - \\log(y_{i,t})\\right] = \\alpha - \\frac{(1 - e^{-\\beta T})}{T} \\log(y_{i,t}) + \\lambda X_{i,t} + \\varepsilon_{i,t} $$ The conclusions and parameter meanings are the same as those for absolute convergence, as conditional convergence implies that economic growth is related to the structural environment of the economy, hence the inclusion of $X_{i,t}$ as control variables. The inconvenience of introducing control variables $X_{i,t}$ is that we have to study exogeneity again. (3) Club Convergence In groups with similar economic characteristics and similar growth paths, convergence exists within the group, but not between different economic groups. This phenomenon is called club convergence (Durlauf, 1995; Galor, 1996). $$ \\frac{1}{T}\\left[\\log(y_{i,t+T}) - \\log(y_{i,t})\\right] = \\alpha + \\beta \\log(y_{i,t}) + \\lambda D + \\varepsilon_{i,t} $$ The variable meanings are the same as above, except that convergence is indicated only when $\\beta \u003c 0$, where $D_{i,t}$ is a dummy variable, i.e., grouping, such as all of East Asia following the same development path, or several cities developing as port cities. An interesting study I found is modeling based on clustering criteria, such as using the “middle-income trap” as a clustering criterion11. Du (2017) (who is from Shandong University) introduced a Stata package to perform the econometric convergence test and club clustering algorithm by Phillips and Sul (2007)1213.

He shows that expressing the sorrow of parting doesn’t require depicting agonizing deathbed scenes; avoiding reality can also be an act of love. He demonstrates that cameras deceive, as memories are subjective creations, not objective records. He reveals a world beyond the lens filled with death and devoid of fantasy, portraying humans as nothing more than cranky, tantrum-prone kids. In your darkest moments, after peeling back the layers of your mother and Eri, you finally see Yuta’s truth— His mother transforms from a demanding parent into a gentle, caring figure. Eri transforms from a grumpy girl with glasses into a kind, understanding friend. Yuta fears losing his mother, so he resorts to explosions. Yuta fears losing Eri, so he turns her into a vampire. Reality has no explosions or vampires. The nested stories form a narrative trick—a reflection of how Yuta perceives himself, his growth, and his values. Life is an inevitably futile struggle. Adding a touch of fantasy is one of our few comforting choices. Isn’t it beautiful to pursue that fantasy, even if it doesn’t exist? If it’s not real, does that mean it’s not worth pursuing? Isn’t it beautiful?\rBut I won’t be moved by someone’s pursuit of fantasy or insistence on idealism. In times of economic stagnation, everyone seeks reasons to keep living, which isn’t so different from chasing fantasy. I don’t need someone to persuade me to pursue fantasy. I need to understand what I’m doing. Through this story, Tatsuki Fujimoto narrates the quiet process of self-discovery. A psychologist might choose a warm story to encourage realism. A madman kicks down the door, barges in, and, after breaking you with grim realities, scams you into believing in fantasies. This is the kind of creator Fujimoto is—a madman. No matter how cruel the world is, even if through the self-hypnosis of fantasy, please fall in love with it at all costs. This is the hypnosis Fujimoto, the peddler of fantasy films, performs on his readers. Humans seek nonexistent fantasy to survive—don’t resist this inevitability. Thus—Yuta sees himself as: Words fail to convey how much effort I’ve poured into loving this world. Please understand yourself too. Now, do you understand? To live in this world, one creates a mindset. Fantasy and films are just manifestations. Recognize this fantasy—not to shape others, but to know yourself.\r","date":"2023-09-12","objectID":"/en/posts/zjhl/:5:0","tags":["Anime"],"title":"Goodbye, Eri: Not Remembering Others, but Knowing Oneself","uri":"/en/posts/zjhl/"},{"categories":["Reading"],"content":"I.

The phrase “Heaven and Earth are not benevolent, treating all things as straw dogs” originally meant that natural laws treat all species equally, yet many use it to condemn the heartlessness of nature. “The Selfish Gene” aims to argue for a perspective on “evolutionary theory” akin to natural law—that genes are the fundamental unit of natural selection (the concepts of “fundamental,” “optimal,” and “sole” are entirely different, and the controversy in understanding lies here). Natural selection and genes possess no subjective consciousness; what intrigues us is the mechanism through which they drive species transformation. The author, Dawkins, himself complained in the 30th-anniversary introduction1: “The Selfish Gene has been criticized for anthropomorphizing genes, which requires explanation (if not apology).” In this book, the meaning of selfishness is taking all actions to enhance survival probability in nature—implying no subjective consciousness, moral standards, or cultural phenomena, merely quantified as increased genetic inheritance probability. The author also considered titles like “The Cooperative Gene” or “The Immortal Gene,” ultimately choosing “The Selfish Gene” likely to create a stark contrast with biological altruistic behaviors, but with two requirements: Genes are purposeless and unconscious Selfish behavior refers to enhancing one’s own natural survival probability The laws of species evolution ≠ the laws of societal operation. The author advocates distinguishing evolutionary theory from social development, emphasizing that this book focuses on explaining biological behaviors through natural selection.

Natural Selection and Evolutionary Theory Forty years ago, gene-related research wasn’t as widespread as today; now, the importance of genes is self-evident, but we must avoid “genetic determinism” thinking. Although Darwin left us “natural selection,” its mechanisms remained enigmatic. Is the unit of evolution the individual, population, or gene? How to explain animal altruistic behaviors? Do You Truly Understand Evolutionary Theory? Analyze the motivation behind parental favoritism? Why are animal conflicts ritualistic—why do they drive away intruders rather than exterminate them? Does animal camouflage constitute conscious deception? What drives cooperation and competition among individuals? If reproduction is the pursuit of survival, why do aging and death exist? Beyond these, the greatest question: how can the above issues be unified within the framework of “natural selection”??? Taking “use and disuse” as an example, this represents individual selection: Giraffes’ necks gradually lengthen with environmental changes, with natural selection manifesting as the evolutionary development of individual traits. Internet image, Digimon evolution path: For individual selection theory, natural selection resembles Digimon super-evolution—individual traits change for survival\rThe “selfish gene selection” perspective in this book differs: Genes initially combine randomly, mutations are accidental, and genes pursue stability. This means both long-necked and short-necked giraffes existed initially, but short-necked ones couldn’t reach food, were eliminated, leaving only long-necked individuals. Self-drawn image, a genetic hourglass: For gene selection theory, individuals are merely gene carriers; natural selection filters existing genes, then recombines them into more stable states. This book terms organisms as “survival machines” for genes.\rThe author chooses to treat “genes” as the fundamental unit of natural selection2. As shown below, studying biological evolution can expand infinitely from genes, individuals, races, communities, to civilizations. The author believes it’s better to focus on the smallest unit to study evolutionary processes. Any changes at higher levels essentially originate from changes in fundamental constituent units (this view remains controversial in evolutionary theory circles).

The Argumentative Approach from Phenomenon to Essence Although this book is a popular science work on “evolutionary theory,” I perceive shadows of economics within it. Darwin left us “natural selection”; Adam Smith left us “the invisible hand.” How does natural selection occur? Kinship unit, racial unit, and individual unit advocates argue incessantly; Is the market mechanism omnipotent? Liberals and Keynesians attack each other over this. Selfish genes ≠ all assumptions in this book; Rational economic man ≠ all assumptions in economics; Both essentially make theoretical assumptions about real-world phenomena that are difficult to verify, merely providing an explanatory perspective. The difficulty with social science viewpoints lies in: even if you discover an elegant theory to explain reality, in a world full of friction, how do you prove their causal relationship?3 Economics employs experiments and econometrics for proof; this book primarily establishes frameworks and argues through logical deduction—exposing contradictions in other individualist and populationist theories, yet seems somewhat lacking in positive evidence for its own viewpoint (hence this book’s perspective doesn’t appear mainstream in biology, with somewhat insufficient positive evidence). The chapter logic essentially follows4: $$ \\begin{align} \u0026 \\text{Biological behavior} \\Rightarrow \\text{why race/individual selection is wrong} \\Rightarrow \\text{gene selection} \\newline \u0026 \\text{Altruistic behavior motivation} \\Rightarrow \\text{profit} - \\text{cost} \\geq 0 \\end{align} $$ Whenever the author discusses gene selection, this book resembles a comprehensive modeling manual, offering unique perspectives and eloquent language. Dawkins extensively employs “game theory” to explore survival strategies in animal behavior, uses “equilibrium” to describe genetic inheritance steady states, “sorting” to depict kinship relationships, and “operations research” to analyze parenting strategies. Overall positive arguments lean toward logical deduction. I fully agree with the deductive logic emphasized in this book: This book avoids illustrative arguments, circular reasoning, and using biology to argue sociology, employing logical deduction instead. Some say: Baboons are human ancestors, baboons are selfish, therefore humans are even more so. This confuses biological relationships. Some say: Animals A, B, C, D all behave this way, therefore humans do too. Such illustrative arguments easily manipulate viewpoints. Some say: Only superior individuals can reproduce. This is circular reasoning, with “superior” and “reproduction” mutually justifying each other. (Actually, “effort leads to success” and “heaven rewards diligence” also constitute circular reasoning. I prefer to term such inspirational logic as survivalist philosophy—manifestations of survival wisdom used for self-affirmation, self-promotion, and self-comfort, often beneficial for individual growth. Rather than absolute rules of societal operation, they represent ideal environments social sciences aim to shape—environments conducive to developing forward-looking5 moral perspectives.) Initially reading like many readers, I found the argumentative logic in certain chapters ambiguous. Later summarizing revealed each chapter’s structure essentially follows: Self-drawn image, logical paradigm: This book’s logic isn’t observing b from a, but comparing nature’s filtering of all species, examining genes from evolutionary processes, first identifying correlations between genes and behaviors, then conducting mental model interventions, finally screening for causality.\rFirst proposing new definitions and animal behavior questions, then refuting errors in other theoretical levels, followed by deducing gene selection logic. Seemingly selfless choices to help others at individual, kinship, and clan levels ultimately reduce to means for gene self-perpetuation.

Beyond Zoology: MEME (Memes) What’s remarkable is that beyond evolutionary theory, this book has made significant contributions! To analogize “gene” transmission, Dawkins coined “meme” from the Greek root “mimeme” (to mimic) (to create lexical parallelism with “gene”). Often called “memes”; in the CITIC Publishing version I read, it’s translated as “觅母” (seeking mother).\rWe frequently encounter various meme images on the internet: meme\rMeme images and other popular symbols represent certain cultures or events, possessing heritability yet potentially varying among individuals—sharing, spreading, mutating. This transmission phenomenon resembles gene propagation and is termed MEME. “The Selfish Gene” already clarifies it’s not “social Darwinism,” but in Chapter 11 “The New Replicators,” elaborates the author’s perspective on culture. Society operates and develops under the dual-track system of “genes” and “memes.” Animal deception appears unconscious, more instinctual for survival, manifesting as genetic behaviors and appearance deception. Humanity’s uniqueness lies in culture—some cultures even appear anti-genetic!

Humanity’s Uniqueness “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind” introduced me to de-anthropocentrism. Homo sapiens is merely one species in human evolution; humanity might not be particularly remarkable. You could say humans domesticated rice, but equally, rice domesticated humans—once freely roaming mountains, humans became confined around fields. Many works’ “de-anthropocentrism” views humans as Earth’s ecological destroyers, even considering humanity Earth’s pests7. From a clear Marxist political economy stance, it’s genuine anthropocentrism—environmental protection aims to preserve biodiversity (symbiosis rather than harmful parasitism), ultimately maintaining this diversity to protect humanity. Human-world interaction constitutes subject-object relationships; transforming the world is natural. This work appears as gene-controlled organisms’ “de-anthropocentrism,” yet by distinguishing natural selection from social development, humans still seem unique. Kinship selection and individual selection theories inevitably face dilemmas explaining “altruistic behaviors.” Gene selection theory patches this theoretically as follows: $$ \\begin{cases} Superficially\\ altruistic: P_{individual} - C_{individual} \\leq 0 \\newline Actually\\ selfish: P_{gene} - C_{gene} \\geq 0 \\end{cases} \\newline $$ $$ \\begin{cases} Finite\\ game: selfish\\ strategy \\newline Infinite\\ game: selfish\\ strategy \\rightarrow cooperative\\ strategy \\end{cases} $$ From a moral perspective, I find this intriguing. Subjectively perceived altruism and natural selection-driven altruism intersect. Setting aside evolutionary theory in social development and examining moral behaviors alone: does purely conscious altruistic morality exist in humans? $B - A \\sim \\varnothing$: Is the set difference A minus B empty? If not empty, what causes it? This likely closely relates to dilemmas faced by gene selection theory. The article’s most incisive viewpoint suggests all assumed altruistic behaviors are actually genetically selfish. Does this truly encompass all morality?\rGene selection theory’s own dilemma is explaining useless traits: Examples include cross-species affection, homosexuality, moths flying into flames, zebra stripes… If viewed as gene-driven, numerous hypotheses exist. Perhaps we cannot comprehend special traits, but they’re actually beneficial; perhaps elimination requires time; such traits might emerge because they represent evolutionary transitional phases or unfinished products; certain pressures might cause genetic dysregulation (e.g., genes providing random hormone levels in humans)… If viewed as gene-independent behaviors, we generally default to human uniqueness. Genes lack purpose and consciousness; compared to genes and animals, humans possess remarkable foresight. Human behaviors and societal operations stem from dual influences of nature and culture. Rather than worrying about human nature, what we can do is vigorously transmit altruistic ideologies through memes (MEMEs). (For me personally, whether de-anthropocentric or anthropocentric, the major premise seems difficult to prove.)

Being good in environment a doesn’t guarantee goodness in environment b. Death genes: Is individual death a manifestation of racial selection altruism? The key lies in how death genes are viewed. Viewpoint: Many death genes exist worldwide; currently retained death genes are beneficial—they function to delay host reproduction. Further speculation: Death genes within bodies are good genes that have aged, while another good gene works to postpone this aging process until after reproduction accelerates. Further speculation: Deception genes—delayed reproduction might enable longer survival. (Here too, the author only conducts logical deduction without evidence indicating the above viewpoints are correct.) Cloning vs. reproduction: Since asexual reproduction exists, why do human genes choose sexual reproduction? Genes continuously experiment with combinations to find optimal arrangements. Asexual reproduction resembles growth without distinction; reproduction manifests differences, comparing original team combinations’ quality, allowing each to find its optimal destiny8. Genes exhibit free-riding and opportunistic behaviors; sexual reproduction carries some useless genes.

Fighting over territory, losers leave rather than being exterminated. Is this racial unit altruism?” This chapter argues: gene combinations create biological survival strategies; different survival strategies interact; failed strategies recombine to refine survival approaches until various strategies reach equilibrium (ESS). The argumentative approach resembles economics’ “duopoly Swigert model” and “game theory” (from grim strategies—hawkish, dovish—to delayed, mixed strategy games) discussing steady-state outcomes under different strategies. Intraspecies competition is symmetrical; extermination isn’t steady-state. For example, the Three Kingdoms period persisted long; if three identical countries existed, they might endure indefinitely9. Interspecies competition is asymmetrical; extermination is steady-state. Lions hunting deer represents genetically determined hunting and escape strategies—this is steady-state equilibrium.

Thus, second-best becomes “individual altruism,” actually “genetic selfishness.” How to explain cross-species altruistic behaviors like dolphins saving humans or wolf children? The author considers these extreme behaviors, unrepresentative, requiring further statistics. Genes lack consciousness and mathematical ability, thus this calculation occurs through trait-manifested appearance judgments, also producing deceptive survival strategies.

Is this racial selection altruism? Traditional racial selection theory’s two explanations: Conspicuous display: Some researchers believe birds gather to observe current population size and control reproduction numbers. Territory: Many animals first compete for territory, then reproduce. Limited territory means those without territory don’t reproduce, controlling population numbers. Essentially, territory serves as animals’ reproduction certificates. Traditional theories treat parental love as exceptional, distinguishing it from ordinary altruistic behaviors. The author believes all reproducers “choose” between birthing and rearing. On one hand, each individual attempts maximal reproduction to perpetuate genes. On the other, more reproduction increases survival pressure. Thus, individuals choose between reproduction numbers and rearing pressure, not based on population size. I think the difference becomes clearer using common economic representation: Self-drawn image, economic approach to equilibrium points: Racial selection theory involves individual reproduction demand versus others’ reproduction supply; gene selection involves individual allocation between reproduction and rearing. Personally, it’s refinement rather than refutation. Analogous to economics, gene selection theory’s rearing cost changes partly stem from others’ reproduction situations.\rSelf-drawn image, economic approach to equilibrium points: Racial selection theory involves individual reproduction demand versus others’ reproduction supply; gene selection involves individual allocation between reproduction and rearing. Personally, it’s refinement rather than refutation. Analogous to economics, gene selection theory’s rearing cost changes partly stem from others’ reproduction situations. If individuals choose reproduction based on population numbers, as birds, optimal strategy would be pretending to reproduce heavily, making others reproduce less, then secretly reproducing more. But eventually everyone reproduces heavily, leading to collapse. Animals without territory don’t lose reproductive capacity but wait until having territory to reproduce. The key isn’t just “how many” but also “when.” Some Reflection They say economics is the best catalyst. Reflecting on today, I find the author’s analysis quite reasonable. Current situations resemble inverted U-curves: the poor reproduce more, the rich reproduce more, the middle class reproduces less. “Poor Economics” essentially reaches similar conclusions—the poor’s expectations for changing survival pressures differ from the middle class, each class’s survival pressures and expectations closely related. In places like Africa, the poorer have more children hoping for change—why is reversal difficult? The 2020 Nobel laureate’s answer: poor people’s funds prioritize solving survival pressures like food, water, slightly better—television, while the middle class seeks more human capital investment, making reversal difficult. Essentially, the poor start negative, the middle class accumulates from zero. Of course, this surpasses “The Selfish Gene” topics.

How do favored individuals respond?” Notably, this favoritism exhibits intergenerational characteristics. Among siblings, parents might favor the strongest, the weakest, or the youngest. Among descendants, compared to children, parents might favor grandchildren. Essentially maximizing expected genetic benefits. For example, a mother’s total resources are $c$, $U_i(C_i)$ represents genetic continuation benefits from allocating $C_i$ to the $i$th child. $$ \\begin{align} \\max E(X) \u0026= \\sum_{i=1}^{n} U_i(C_i) \\newline st. \\sum_{i=1}^{n} C_i \u0026= c \\end{align} $$ Parental favoritism motivation: $U_a(C) - U_b(C) \u003e 0 \\Rightarrow E(X)_{max}$ How to explain female “menopause”?10 For parents, children have closer kinship than grandchildren, but grandchildren have longer expected lifespans, thus tending to invest in grandchildren $U_{grandchild}(C) - U_{child}(C) \u003e 0$. If parents could reproduce at any age, motivation for investing in grandchildren would diminish; selfish genes would disrupt reproductive genes. Does favoritism only create sibling rivalry? From a genetic perspective, siblings share identical genetic content with me—genetic interest community. If allocating resources to a yields greater utility than to b, b understands, just as older brothers care for younger brothers. How do weaker, potentially abandoned offspring respond to such favoritism? How do weaker, potentially abandoned offspring respond to such favoritism? If parents don’t feed them, constant crying might attract predators. Thus parents decide: “Is feeding value greater than killing cost?” Their game: “Is obtaining food value greater than predator attraction risk?” Hence “only children truly feel secure in being loved” (tongue-in-cheek). Another hypothesis: Selfish birds, for self-survival, push their own siblings out of the nest immediately after hatching? Verifying the above hypothesis cleverly uses symmetry (this should be problem-solving techniques middle school teachers mention in solving equations—the rarity lies in transcending equations to see problems). For equations $\\begin{cases} x+y=3 \\newline xy=2 \\end{cases}$, since $x$ and $y$ play identical roles, solutions must satisfy $x=y$. A bird is both previous generation’s child and next generation’s parent. If truly selfish enough to harm siblings, yet genetically they’re identical, then this genetic individual highly values itself. Loving itself more than its own children, it wouldn’t reproduce—such genes inevitably go extinct. The author refutes this viewpoint; I increasingly see resemblance to contemporary “marriage-free” ideology.

Many mating genetic strategies exist worldwide: one chooses pursuing quantity, actively seeking mates, not providing nourishment; another chooses providing nourishment, passively attracting mates. Theoretically polygynous, yet men and women employ different strategies seeking equilibrium. Genetically, children inherit $\\frac{1}{2}$ genes from each parent, but parents’ initial investments differ. Each aims to maximize gene transmission with minimal expected cost. This involves multiple decisions: reproduction methods, rearing methods (investment in offspring), rearing goals (gender, traits…) $P$ represents genetic inheritance benefits after having children, $C$ represents personal costs.

For marine life, females typically release eggs into water first, then males seek them—females possess sufficient advantage to leave early, leaving males to rear alone. For terrestrial life, males possess first-leaving advantage. Regarding rearing methods, assuming males have loyal and disloyal strategies, females have testing and non-testing strategies.

Before the advent of the camera, painters pursued realism. Correspondingly, the Romanticism of the Renaissance was a style characterized by exaggerated creativity. Romanticism isn’t just a genre; it’s an impulse! Any work can have a touch of romanticism. With the emergence of the camera, painters began to contemplate the differences between painting and photography. People started to deliberately emphasize rough brushstrokes and “mental tones.” Among them is a unique brushstroke\rMost styles of painting in the modern era are essentially “reconstructions” of the real world, combining brushstrokes with the artist’s understanding of the world’s essence. Futurists: Science can explain everything; it’s a symbol of order. We should use orderly geometric shapes to compose our works and showcase the beauty of rationality. Symbolists: All cognition is a product of society. To stimulate people’s thinking on a topic, we need to transfer the same object to different scenarios. For example, moving a spoon from a table to the ceiling, or replacing actors in a stage play with wooden stakes in an open-air mine. Our inexplicability is precisely to alienate things, thus provoking people’s reflection (classic anthropological alienation). Impressionists: Colors, light, and time are constantly changing. What we paint is just the light atmosphere at a specific moment in time. We need to learn to observe, to observe the changes in color and light of an object under various conditions. (That’s why Monet painted over 300 versions of “Water Lilies”). Pointillists: The colors of light can be expressed by the three primary colors. By letting the three primary colors form dots that overlap and eventually create an image. Collage Art: Reassemble everyday objects to express ideas, and materials such as newspapers and posters can also be reassembled into a new work. Dada Art: Gradually entering the realm of conceptual deconstruction and reflection. All concepts should be deconstructed and reexamined. So, in the eyes of Dadaists, a toilet becomes a fountain, and a clothes hanger becomes an octopus. apple man\rOnce we understand the artists’ principles and backgrounds, previously perplexing images seem to become more understandable. Nowadays, many “performance art” pieces and inexplicable paintings may make people feel that art is just empty boasting. I think, in fact, discussions about painting concepts ultimately lead to abstraction. Just like some branches of mathematics, when taken to certain depths, lose the concept of numbers. Painters abstract concepts and expressions themselves, and then use incomprehensible actions to express themselves. It seems that abstraction through paintings is a trend in the so-called avant-garde. First-class art is intoxicating in appearance, or concise and easy to understand, and the icing on the cake is understanding the connotation. Second-rate art is incomprehensible in appearance, but once you understand the connotation, you can see the light. Third-rate art is boring in appearance and pretends to be sophisticated. I believe that aesthetic appreciation in art is also a process of interaction between knowledge and images. Therefore, interpreting the same painting with the background of the times can lead to different personal perceptions. Perhaps, the reader’s perspective on the appreciation of the work itself becomes an art alongside the era. The main benefit an artist or authority brings is simply that their status allows us to have the patience to think about and try to understand their actions. Therefore, when facing artists, we choose to think rather than blindly follow them.

People yearn for the medieval times much like they long for the idyllic countryside—a utopia that exists solely in the realm of imagination. Strangely enough, there are those who find solace in pursuing a different path, even if it leads them astray—people like myself, who revel in the unconventional. Such individuals find joy in this “quirky” compendium. What I mean to say is, if you’re not the type to delve into “strict history” or merely a gamer seeking entertainment, then perhaps you’re the kind to seek philosophy in games and dark humor in history. Well, congratulations, you’re ready to embark on your journey through the medieval world. This book is not suited for those seeking a detailed understanding of the medieval period. It follows the main theme of “heroic dragon-slaying role-playing,” presenting popular medieval tales and literature in a digestible format. This implies that there’s no obligation to provide a comprehensive educational framework covering the economic, cultural, and political aspects of the era. Unlike traditional history books that offer analytical viewpoints, this book occasionally offers the author’s perspective on the use of historical sources. Are laws reliable? People of that time didn’t necessarily follow them; the focus lies more on exploring the motives behind lawmaking. Are diaries sincere? Many medieval individuals clandestinely recorded their mastery of magic or their various exploits, yet some narratives and their subsequent personal records harbor hidden contradictions. HOW TO SLAY A DRAGON: A Fantasy Hero’s Guide to the Real Middle Ages\rThis book primarily focuses on elucidating the everyday aspects of life during the medieval period: From unicorns to the fantastical creatures of the time, From troubadours to the ballads of the era, From cursed marshes to poorly managed latrines, From courtship to the moral codes of the time. It delves into topics such as medieval bathroom practices, dental hygiene, road systems, inns, and even rustic romance. What captivates the reader is the contrast between the titles and the content, drawing them into the next intriguing chapter. The examples provided by the author are remarkably close to life and imbued with humor. For instance, were there really records of religious miracles and magical occurrences in the medieval period? Indeed, there are documented instances of individuals keeping diaries (in the form of autobiographies) detailing their studies in magic, which were later studied by others—resulting in a profound sense of shame. As for the various daily occurrences in medieval life, the author doesn’t shy away from employing witty and satirical language. Take, for instance, the scenario of the three individuals in a duel, where the one who initially arrived naked ends up surviving—a lesson for all: “In the medieval times, always carry a weapon in secret.” Regarding unclean neighbors, the sentiment is expressed as “Neighbors will be neighbors; they’re not cursed until their excrement blocks the streets, at which point perhaps they do become cursed—curses may be false, but filth is real.” And in the Byzantine Empire, where bizarre tragedies are anything but unusual, nothing seems out of the ordinary. As the author doubles as a narrator and a guide through the adventures of the hero, these humorous remarks infuse the book with a strong sense of interactivity. Moreover, the titles themselves carry a distinct flavor reminiscent of Japanese anime RPGs. While microhistory books like “Soulstealers: The Chinese Sorcery Scare of 1768” and “1587, a Year of No Significance: The Ming Dynasty in Decline” meticulously analyze individual historical records to support overarching themes, this book takes a different approach.

Initially, I read the electronic version, but after finishing it, I was so impressed that I immediately bought the physical book. The book truly lives up to its preface in the first edition: the examples are vivid and interesting, and it skillfully explains the tricky variations of each exam point, leaving a deep impression. Special thanks to the github re-book project team (2019) for the $\\LaTeX$ typesetting of the book. As an introductory book on probability theory and mathematical statistics, we do not want to lead students directly into the mathematical paradise. Instead, we first explore the various landscapes of probability and statistics in the “wild,” and then enter the mathematical paradise, making various concepts and theorems well-grounded and meaningful. This approach allows students to find the book interesting and feel that it is different from reading a typical mathematics textbook. Of course, we also pay great attention to the proofs and discussions of some regularities extracted from randomness, as only by understanding these can one feel them more profoundly.

First, substitute the villagers’ perspective of conditional probability, and assume initial values: $$ \\begin{cases} \\text{The boy is trustworthy and lies: } P(A|B)=0.1\\\\ \\text{The boy is untrustworthy and lies: } P(A|\\overline{B})=0.5 \\end{cases}\\ $$ After the boy lies, the villagers will reassess their trust in the boy, so the premise is that the boy has lied, and trust is represented as $P(B|A)$. After the first lie, substitute into Bayes’ equation: $$ \\begin{align*} P(B|A) \u0026 = \\frac{P(B)P(A|B)}{P(B)P(A|B) + P(\\bar B)P(A|\\bar B) } \\\\ \u0026 = \\frac{0.8\\times0.1}{0.8\\times0.1 + 0.2\\times0.5} = 0.444 \\end{align*} $$ That is, the villagers’ trust in the boy changes as follows: $$ \\text{Prior Probability} \\begin{cases} P(B)=0.8\\\\ P(\\overline{B})=0.2 \\end{cases} \\stackrel{\\text{After one lie}}{\\longrightarrow}\\text{Posterior Probability} \\begin{cases} P(B|A)=0.444\\\\ P(\\overline{B}|A)=0.556 \\end{cases} $$ That is, after one lie, the villagers’ trust in the boy becomes $P({B})=0.444$ and $P({B})=0.556$. Similarly, after the second lie, trust becomes: $$ P(B|A) = \\frac{0.444\\times0.1}{0.444\\times0.1 + 0.556\\times0.5} = 0.138 $$ In summary, after two lies, the villagers’ trust in the boy changes from $P(B)=0.8$ to $P(B)=0.138$. This is how repeated lies lead to a loss of trust. Why Bayesian Estimation is Great The meaning of Bayesian estimation is to adjust probability values based on parameters at any time. Like Sherlock Holmes’ reasoning, first list all possibilities, and as evidence increases, update the belief values for each possibility. Another school of thought is the frequentist approach, where the real parameters are fixed, and a large amount of data is used to estimate the real parameters. From this perspective, Bayesian estimation is even a worldview. ","date":"2023-08-01","objectID":"/en/posts/probability/:3:2","tags":["Probability Theory"],"title":"Estimating π with a Needle?

Taxing first and then refunding sounds like a bizarre plan, but think about it: what if we consider the deposit for “shared bikes or shared power banks” as a tax? The deposit, like Varian’s oil tax, is paid first and then refunded. The deposit is an additional charge on top of the shared bike or power bank usage fee, just as the oil tax is an additional charge on gasoline consumption. Both the deposit and the oil tax are fully refunded. The original question: Will taxing oil and then refunding it to consumers change their consumption? Transformed into: If the deposit for shared bikes or power banks increases, will consumers’ consumption change? Let’s assume there are two types of people in the market: One is a wealthy person who has 100 dollars a day, spends 50 dollars on personal consumption, and can even spend the other 50 dollars on “Crazy Fridays” for others. The other is a worker who only has 50 dollars a day, barely enough for personal consumption, with no extra money for KFC. For both groups, when the deposit for shared power banks is 0 dollars, each consumes two power banks a day. But one day, the deposit for power banks increases to 50 dollars! The wealthy person doesn’t care; they still spend 100 dollars on two power banks and continue to enjoy life after receiving the refund. The worker, however, is in trouble. The deposit has increased from 0 dollars to 100 dollars, but they only have 50 dollars! Unless they borrow money, they can’t afford the deposit. As a result, the worker reduces their consumption from two power banks a day to one. So in this market, even though the deposit is refunded, the number of power banks rented daily has decreased from 4 to 3. The increase in deposit has no effect on the wealthy person’s consumption $x$, but the worker’s consumption has decreased from $x$ to $x\\prime$. The average market consumption change: $\\frac{x+x}{2} \\Rightarrow\\frac{x+x^{\\prime}}{2}$, and indeed, market consumption has decreased! This is why Varian says in the book ( Original English textbook link: Intermediate Microeconomics) That’s because he is average, not because of any causal connection Varian distinguishes between “consumers” and “average consumers.” That is, the wealthy person (consumer) in the market is not affected by the deposit, but the worker is, and as a result, the overall market (average consumer) consumption decreases.

But there is another explanatory perspective, treating the policy as forcing everyone to engage in intertemporal consumption.

Mathematical Explanation Once the “non-mathematical explanation” is understood, we can look at the mathematical analysis provided in the book. The entire tax burden is shifted to consumers, meaning the price of gasoline rises. (Because some workers cannot afford the deposit, even though it will be refunded.) Taxing and then refunding ultimately leaves income unchanged. The first point indicates that the substitution effect occurs: as the price of gasoline rises, consumers are willing to spend more on other goods instead of gasoline. Therefore, the final consumption of oil by consumers must be $x^\\prime$ after the price change, not the original $x$. The second point indicates that, overall, income has not changed, so there is no income effect. This is why the book distinguishes between “consumers” and “average consumers.” The average consumer’s reaction to taxing and refunding is to reduce consumption, as they perceive gasoline as more expensive, with the tax burden shifted as $t$. $$ \\begin{cases} \\text{Before: }px+y=m\\newline \\text{Now: }(p+t)x\\prime+y\\prime=m+tx\\prime \\end{cases} $$ Diagram\r","date":"2023-07-06","objectID":"/en/posts/fla/:3:0","tags":["Microeconomics"],"title":"Analysis of the Tax Refund Case in Varian’s \"Microeconomics\"","uri":"/en/posts/fla/"},{"categories":["Film and TV"],"content":" It was only after a long, long time that I began to understand—in the sorrow of the last emperor, “the last” far outweighs “the emperor.” When the whip of history drives forward, it does not stop lashing because of the traveler’s identity; it simply, monotonously repeats the actions of closing and opening doors, always ready to close the next one. History has no emotions; the suffering and happiness of life merely push people forward, adding fuel to an indifferent flame. This carriage does not care who is outside, brushing off the rising dust, even though those lingering outside were once the masters of the carriage. This “door” is the spokesperson of history in the film, embodying the dual meanings of “connection and separation.” It is majestic, for we cannot see the other side of the era; It is stern, capable of isolating a person at the end of an era; It is merciful, allowing everyone to sense the possibility of crossing over. The Last Emperor—the noblest person, the one who cannot catch up, the door that cannot be opened; Suzume—the distance between death and everyday life is just a door; The Whale—does the self-saver have the courage to cross the threshold of sorrow? It’s just that during this period, I abruptly watched a series of movies, all of which involved doors, so much so that when I began to look back, a tall door always appeared before my eyes. And the reality of the siege, the surge of artificial intelligence, feels like another opening and closing of a door, leaving people from two eras staring at each other. If the wise have already sensed the existence of the door, what would they say about their own powerlessness? Perhaps only when a person passes through doors of various shapes and sizes can they get closer to the door of history, but they will also be blocked by the next door they cannot pass through. Just a sigh: In the vastness of life, we are but fleeting travelers. ———————— By the way: They say this AI is the next industrial revolution. Although I use GPT very happily, I still have doubts. Because an industrial revolution requires an energy revolution as its foundation, and currently, GPT Plus is constantly shrinking and halting sales due to reaching a bottleneck in computing power. 5G is strong, but the cost of materials greatly limits its spread. Without an energy revolution, AI’s computing power is insufficient, which greatly restricts its potential. Also, everything about AI is currently in the experimental stage, like Go. AI has not brought much displacement; the industries it has spawned are mostly tools. Recently, the most popular thing is that a simple bug can defeat KATAgo by exploiting a small weakness, showing that once a bug in AI is found, it can paralyze everything. Therefore, AI can only be a tool. For example, no matter how much autonomous vehicle technology develops, as long as the road shape remains unchanged, it will never pass review. Language models are only a part of intelligence, and it is hard to say directly that they can surpass humans.

During the boring time of the Chinese New Year holidays, I finally finished reading “The Calling of Spirits.” In 1768, a panic of sorcery called “The Calling of Spirits” swept across the land of the Qing Empire. Surprisingly, the terms “prosperous era” and “sorcery” became parallel concepts. Kong Feili followed the thread of the “sorcery/hair-cutting case” and dissected the entire class structure of the Qing Dynasty—faced with the unheard-of sorcery of hair-cutting, each class had its own interpretation. In summary, the “Calling of Spirits” case involves three main threads: The panic and public dissemination of sorcery among common people. The political concerns and exploitation of the “Calling of Spirits” by the emperor. The bureaucratic dilemma of officials fearing pressure from above and below.

The “Calling of Spirits” case involved an unheard-of form of sorcery where one’s money could be stolen simply by cutting off their braid. For the common people, who believed in the existence of the soul, “calling of spirits” was a widely circulated folk custom, providing a foundation for belief in sorcery. China’s deep-rooted local sentiment made it easier for people to demonize outsiders. At this time, Chinese construction workers and the monk class, due to the transient nature of their professions, were particularly susceptible to suspicion. The expansion of the “Calling of Spirits” incidents originated from these transient populations.

Faced with sorcery, the Qing Dynasty faced inherent cultural contradictions. Despite Emperor Qianlong’s early attempts to distance the “hair-cutting case” from political dissent, the braided queue remained a symbol of Manchu identity. As rulers of the Qing Dynasty, their attitude reflected not only fear of rebellion but also dissatisfaction with the Sinicization of the Manchus. The inherent weakness of feudal dynasties was evident in the legal ambiguity regarding “sorcery.” While the emperor and the state used the concept of “divine right” to bolster their legitimacy, sorcery was seen as both a miracle and a threat. This led to vague laws regarding sorcery in the Qing Dynasty, which had to be established nonetheless.

The bureaucratic system of the Qing Dynasty was rife with inequality.The core of Kong Lifai’s research lies in the impact of this system on information dissemination and policy implementation. The emperor regarded bureaucrats as tools, establishing various channels. Although the ceremonial language was cumbersome, it served both as a means of communication and a way to delineate status. Without the ceremonial aspects, the emperor would struggle to bear the burden of pushing through tasks, yet reverting to formality also led to inefficiency. In the “hair-cutting case,” the most prominent aspect was the prevalence of officials’ evaluations filled with flattery and mutual protection. Under the system of mutual recommendation for official selection, actions at all levels were aligned along an axis of interests. Bureaucratic evaluations manifested as a strip, with flattery revolving around imperial power. Qing officials’ evaluations were brief and crude, with achievements attributed to “events.” What’s terrifying is that officials had the ability to control these events, and the moral risk of self-directed deception occurred easily under the desire for positive imperial evaluations and mutual concealment among peers. From this moment on, imperial evaluations had never had such power to influence the course of events, yet Qianlong’s decisions remained loyal to his position as a Manchu emperor. Was this management by an ethnic minority a political distortion? Regardless, as the “calling souls” case shattered, the actors on the stage retreated one by one.

Faced with the same “soul calling” and hair-cutting incidents, the experiences of different social classes are completely different. Kong Feili has conducted a perfect “heterogeneity” analysis and class analysis of society. It is worth noting that this result is a structured classification rather than a combination of multiple quantities. Therefore, I believe that the discussion of “The Soul Calling” should be separated from “The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind”. The “Soul Calling” case has many similarities with the characteristics of the Qing Dynasty. This is an explanation of the decline and turning point under the prosperous age, and it is also the inevitable result of the historical operation of the feudal dynasty. Although the case seems to revolve around the emperor’s attitude, the emperor remains faithful to his class. However, China at this time had not yet achieved harmonious integration of its diverse cultural groups, leading to distortions in the operation of power. How could absurd sorcery emerge in a “prosperous age”? Perhaps coincidence is just a turning point in history. The big fish lurking beneath the surface of the water has never stopped swimming, just casting fleeting shadows in the rise and fall of governance.

Excessive drinking is always harmful to health. Here are some personal insights based on my experiences. The banquets I encountered in several counties generally followed four stages: Stage One: Personal introductions, after which individuals start drinking voluntarily. Stage Two: Mutual exchanges and inviting others to drink, one-on-one. Stage Three: Speech by leaders, giving collective advice, followed by a group toast where everyone stands and toasts around the table. Stage Four: As the banquet wraps up, exchanging WeChat contacts. Strategies for drinking should be flexible and adapted according to each stage. Spell casting preparation: Emphasize repeatedly that you don’t drink, haven’t drunk before, to reduce the difficulty level as much as possible. Stage One: Usually, when standing up to introduce yourself, you can start pouring a bit of the drink from the small or medium-sized glass. Alternatively, you can discreetly pour it out under the table beforehand. When raising the glass, use your hand to cover the side of the glass (fully covering the glass would look too fake!), so that others can’t see the level of the drink, thinking it’s in the pouring state. Stage Two: Because it’s a university student survey, you can eat and drink casually without knowing the rules. Pay attention to see if there’s milk or tea cups on the table. Drink water to one-third full, hold the wine in your mouth after the toast (be careful not to puff your mouth up! Tongue might be quite rough), pretend to drink the beverage, and spill the wine into the beverage. If no beverage is available, the filled bowl of rice or soup is the best hiding tool When others interject to add to the conversation, it’s also a good opportunity for a small move. Typically, at a drinking session, everyone usually watches the person speaking. Stage three: At this point, the meal is almost over and most people are at least tipsy, so they can rest assured. When toasting, cover the sides of the glass with your hands. Join the toasting group and pretend to be drinking, but no wine enters your mouth. Move around a lot. At this time, everyone is usually trying to please others and will usually not notice small movements. It is recommended to use the teachings in Liu Qian’s magic class - big movements cover up small movements to mislead the other party’s attention. For example, one hand makes movements to attract attention, and the other hand gently pours wine on the ground.

The Tourism Bureau has granted the Forbidden City the highest rating and naturally desires to do the same for Dunhuang. However, the Mogao Grottoes have not acquiesced. In former days, the Taoist king had already cast out all the gold, and the resplendent treasures rode makeshift cattle carts, wandering into foreign lands. The sedimented history pays no heed to transient hustle and bustle, while the British Museum, destined for daily foot traffic, bustles incessantly. History chuckles. Faced with vast, magnificent toys, infants find themselves bewildered. Yet, the entirety of culpability does not solely rest upon the Taoist king—Dunhuang was not unearthed in an auspicious era, and even today, I cannot easily sketch the contours of ancients. Thus, here, cultural heritage preservation and dissemination intertwine. To behold Dunhuang is to encounter Dunhuang yet not entirely Dunhuang. This journey has also lifted the veil of mystery in my mind. The image of Dunhuang, akin to the temples of the Maya, has dissolved. The Mogao Grottoes are neither a testament to the grandeur of a mysterious dynasty nor a site of blessings for unknown merchants. The “donors” are part of the Mogao Grottoes culture. In other words—who carved which caves. Everything is recorded plainly! After all, without leaving names, how would the deities receive their “payments”? Dunhuang lacks the unsolved mysteries of the Maya, but conversely, beneath the Maya civilization, there is no deeply sedimented loess land. The establishment of the grottoes spans from the Southern and Northern Dynasties to the Yuan Dynasty, and the marginal expansion of its scale reflects the prosperity and decline of the Silk Road. From the Li family of the Tang Dynasty to nameless merchants, if you dare to dig, you can dig. There are thousands of caves, each unique. Setting aside wealth, these grottoes embrace the “donors” who come and go, regardless of status, place of origin, or time. Relying solely on “flying apsaras” cannot uphold the phrase “Chinese treasure.” The most precious aspect of Dunhuang lies in the flowing years and its unique cultural temperament. History flows over these precipitous cliffs, time flips upside down, and finally condenses at the depths of the caves. From the tiles of the Southern and Northern Dynasties to the Yuan Dynasty, patterns evolve from simple geometric shapes to rounded lotuses. Whether angry or smiling, sharp or gentle, the myriad heavenly deities and Buddhas respond to the times. The multitude of cave entrances symbolizes the interaction of communities. In the long river of history filled with wars, there indeed exists such a solid port of ethnic integration. Inside the caves, there is no strong light; instead, the mineral pigments from the Tang Dynasty cover every surface, creating a faint fluorescent effect. Most of the sculptures I observed were of figures like Shakyamuni Buddha and Guanyin. Simply speaking of the sculptures, I did not perceive any advanced craftsmanship or exquisite expressions. According to the introduction, the internal craftsmanship mainly involves unique filling methods, often utilizing local materials, with a deeper cultural significance such as the reclining Buddha in Nirvana. Observing the seated Buddha indoors is quite marvelous. Unlike viewing the Leshan Giant Buddha under the bright sunlight, leaving nothing unseen, looking up at the seated Buddha inside the cave is different. The shadows above exude a profound sense of emptiness, making the Buddha statue appear enigmatic and compelling one to kneel in reverence.

The Qilian Mountains, with their majestic peaks and ridges, reveal the lean loess skin weathered over ages, adorned with streaks of black and red hues. The mountain summits swell like vertebrae, encircling the narrow passage with a slow, imposing embrace. Today, it serves as a natural pastureland, but yesterday, it was a treacherous gorge. Traveling along the main road, the distant mountains loom, pressed into ink wash, with shades of ochre and cyan dominating the scene. Once vegetation is lost and the mountains no longer provide cover, the vast sky and embracing Gobi become desolate. In this land of beacon fires and billowing smoke, tufts of grass resemble slender arrows, rudely piercing the desert’s skin at inopportune moments.

During a high school reading class, I casually picked up Yan Lianke’s literary essays. His advocacy for Divine Realism lingers with me to this day. While working through advanced mathematics, I suddenly grasped the shared essence of “Divine Realism” and “Magical Realism.” They both take “conveyance” as their mission, much like the rhetoric of ancient Greece, creating a reality of their own. Yet, the crux lies in the scene the novelist chooses to craft—that is where true artistry resides. Confucius said: “Let words convey meaning, and no more.” A critique of the futility in ornate expression, this statement forms the foundation of Divine Realism. These writers forgo flowery language or dazzling rhetoric. Instead, they emphasize the construction of a scene, delivering a visceral experience often laden with lingering aftertaste. The aroma of horses’ hooves, a monk balancing water—is this not such art? Such techniques cannot be summarized as “indirect or metaphorical”; they transcend simplistic categorizations. They emerge from meticulous contemplation of life’s interwoven relations, threading subtle details into profound undertones, capturing the nexus of things with precision. Yan Lianke’s example, recalled now, feels remarkably fitting: imagine the Titanic sinking beneath the waves. How might this be conveyed in a novel? Perhaps a seagull soars by, its body adorned with a small compass, quivering as it passes above the sea, sensing the ship’s magnetic pull. This construct rests firmly upon reality while radiating an uncanny tension. Truly, it embodies the ideal of “The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons”: an antelope hanging its horns on a tree, leaving no trace to follow. Consider the horns of a sheep. Perhaps we know a sheep by its horns because they are familiar to us, but the essence of a sheep is not bound to its horns. Many sheep lack them entirely. If we seize upon the horns as the cornerstone of a sheep’s image, our perspective gains a unique angle. Should this image then shift towards demonic figures or other forms, it ascends to the realm of extraordinary creation. Here lies the ethereal beauty of writing—a spiritual elegance, indeed. The balance between illusion and reality is delicate, like the elusive harmony of “unexpected yet reasonable.” Science rarely speaks in human terms, but pondering such constructs, one realizes that no matter how illusory they appear, their foundation is life’s meticulous observation: feel first, discern connections, then create. Material dictates consciousness—a truth that resonates deeply within me. img\r","date":"2021-05-22","objectID":"/en/posts/sszy/:0:0","tags":["Literature","Reading"],"title":"Divine Realism","uri":"/en/posts/sszy/"},{"categories":["Reading"],"content":" Striving to emulate the writing style of Walden. The beauty of its prose varies greatly between versions. Though I have yet to finish it, each reopening yields fresh insights. I have never been fond of winter’s blazing sun—the crimson orb that casts its light upon an indifferent air. The scant warmth teases the faces of passersby, much like a damp and probing tongue. By mere touch, I feel the burn upon my skin—a harsh caress of light peeling back layers like a blade, as if Siegfried himself wielded his gleaming sword, leaving one’s cheeks tingling, itching, raw. Perhaps it is the rush of blood within, but walking in such weather brings alternating waves of warmth and chill. The body becomes a vessel of fleeting seasons, encased momentarily in ice, then swiftly embraced by sunlight’s fervent touch, only to await the next frost. This interplay of sensation often unfolds on the school’s winter grounds. Uncomfortable though it may be, the symphony of voices brings solace, like the lilting melody of “Ballade pour Adeline,” leaving one entranced. The rhythmic tapping of footsteps and the lively echoes of play compose a sonorous celebration of life. What could rival this healthful and jubilant cadence of existence? The bounce of a basketball on the court sings a hymn of exuberance, its fervor untamed. The friction of a soccer ball against the turf whispers secrets, the soft rustle akin to a golden monkey slipping through the forest’s embrace. Beneath the throbbing drumbeat and the delicate chime of silver bells, the feathery stroke of a badminton bird weaves its airy tapestry—like the frantic flutter of startled pheasants alighting from treetops. Wood, rubber, and plastic collaborate in a playful harmony: the sturdy “thunk” of a paddle meeting ball, the hushed “swoosh” of air past a balloon, the frenetic “hiss” of a rapid volley. Thus, the wise cynic of the West reclines in a shattered barrel, bidding Alexander not to obscure his sun; Zhuangzi likens himself to a mud-bathing turtle, blissfully wagging its tail. Even now, humans find delight in a few planks and a ball—as do I, sharing in their joy. Such simple pleasures cost so little. Adults swing tirelessly at golf, elevating the game to a mark of elegance, their engagements a ceaseless negotiation of self-image. Children, meanwhile, find endless mirth in the toss of a stick. Yet adults, constrained by societal constructs, cannot stop at sticks, striving instead for gilded wheels of industry. Gold outshines the stars, black oil surpasses sweet springs. Two grown men building sandcastles might seem foolish and pitiable; yet, to me, they embody the true essence of life. For life, in its unadorned purity, is nature itself. The earth offers us a tranquil haven, yet humanity, in its pride, constructs fortresses of wealth and power, losing itself in self-made illusions. Only those willing to descend from their towers can truly reclaim themselves, returning to the soil from which they arose. Some may question my seeming indolence. To them, I ask only that they peer deep into Walden’s crystalline depths. A simple life soothes the weary soul; indeed, simplicity is the sole truth of existence.

When Maquia says she feels lonely, the Elder responds, “Do you still feel lonely with me here?” and advises against loving in the mortal world, as it only brings pain. When attacked by human knights, the Elder says, “We have no connection with the mortal world.” From this, we can see the Elder’s attitude: Avoid contact with ordinary people to prevent future sorrow from parting. However, due to human desires, they are forced into contact with humans.

The weft is the livelihood of people, intricately woven on the land, plucking the heartstrings of all. This is the opening line of the movie. From the entire film, I believe this is an interpretation of life. The warp, representing time, is like the lifespan of a person. The weft, representing space, is the encounters of people. Even if the warp is infinitely long, it is still necessary to weave the weft. Weaving memories into cloth, this metaphor of turning the abstract into the concrete, is an expression of giving life meaning. This setting reminds me of Your Name, which is essentially a form of pantheism: We do not worship a specific god, but the deity represented by connections—the red thread of human connections is the deity we worship (paraphrased). Image\rHibiol, as the cloth woven by the Clan of Parting, holds significant meaning. It can be said to be the faith of their existence.

I haven’t figured this out yet. But one reason is that she is pregnant with the child of her enemy (the prince of the human kingdom). To protect the girl, she even gives up the chance to be rescued by her true love, leading to his “darkening.” At this point, the darkened character is also confused: He wants to remain unchanged, but both Maquia and Leilia, who have children, have changed.

The Clan of Parting does not want to face parting, but when they are forced to face the world and become ordinary mothers, encountering children who will eventually leave them, experiencing joy or tears, They come to understand: “Iorph” is a curse of continuity.

Protagonist Maquia: Escapes from disaster, adopts a child from an ordinary family, experiences everything a mother does, and witnesses the child’s departure (in the end, Maquia still looks 15 years old). Being a single mother is not easy (finding work, raising a family, dealing with a rebellious child, and the child’s various “childish promises and comforts”); She actively raises this child because she fears loneliness and wants to share her life, unknowingly developing genuine maternal love. In this segment, pay attention to the changes in Maquia’s hair color and length, as well as her overall appearance. Maquia’s friend Leilia: Forced to bear the child of her enemy and never able to see her again, she meets her daughter after the fall of Mezarte and escapes the kingdom. Leilia is eventually rescued by the last remaining Ancient Dragon and says two lines that caught my attention. A. I can fly. The dragon should be a reflection of her. The dragon finally takes flight to fight for freedom, and she meets her long-lost daughter, then decides to leave. B. “I will forget everything here; you are just a tangled thread in the Hibiol.” Image|344\rEven if it’s a tangled thread, it holds unique emotional significance, but Leilia has indeed had a tough life. Image\rBut can she really forget? For a mother, her child is her parting. The Clan of Parting, untouched by the mortal world, is forced to experience the pain of parting, but this parting seems like a shackle. Mothers lose much for their children—freedom, ideals, and endure unnecessary fears and their children’s anger. Once genuine love is formed, the long-lived mothers can only watch their children grow old. What is the meaning of encountering? Would abandoning encounters also eliminate the pain of parting? Later, Maquia responds to her, “You will never forget.” Indeed, through tears, Leilia says the crucial line: “It’s sad and painful, but how could I forget such a beautiful world?” Because once an encounter happens, the spark cannot be suppressed. Hibiol will record everything. Mothers develop love in the process of raising their children. Like fireworks that eventually fade, the beautiful scene remains in our tender hearts. Now, what does Hibiol truly mean? As the duty and characteristic of the Clan of Parting, I interpret it as “human duty, human characteristics.” The Clan of Parting is just a hypothetical race. Aren’t we just like them, afraid of loss, afraid of parting? Image\rParting seems painful, but it also corresponds to an encounter, a shining moment. Buddhism teaches us to let go of everything, to see it as “empty,” to treat everything as fleeting as dew. But would we still be human if we did that? Should we discard the meaning and happiness of the process just because of a little pain? We fear encounters, lamenting life as fleeting as morning dew; we dread parting, exclaiming life as an illusion, as if life is short and illusory. Thus, the movie creates the nearly immortal Clan of Parting to tell us: Facing encounters and life, bravely loving is unrelated to the length of time or superficial results. Binding the flower of promises at the moment of parting. At the moment of parting, we also pick up those precious memories. That is enough.

The flower of promises: When Maquia, still looking 15, faces the reality of her son growing old: “Mothers don’t cry, but I’m sorry, I can’t keep the promise. Loving you was truly happy.” Breaking the promise in this way is the flower of promises. As long as Maquia lives, her child’s Hibiol will continue. This is the true flower of promises. No one is immortal, but people will continue to encounter each other. Before and after parting, emotions and meanings are bestowed. Parting is not just pain, so please gather the courage to meet new partings! Anime that calmly explores seemingly ethereal themes is truly remarkable.

The Dawn of Farewell - Binding the Flower of Promises on the Morning of Parting is more like an epic of mothers, a history of maternal growth. The theme of the movie is not maternal love; maternal love is just one element of the core proposition. Mothers are always mothers, transcending race and time. These settings cannot be expressed without the anime format, a fairy-tale-like medium. This is why I highly recommend it: This is a work that can only be expressed through anime settings. And this expression transcends anime itself, using a form to write the meaning of encounters. Anime is not just a style; it is a form of expression. Considering the term “anime” itself, isn’t it a form of two-dimensional artistic expression? Hi, Mom, as Jia Ling’s directorial debut, has been critiqued for its technical shortcomings, but that doesn’t hinder its 8.3 rating on Douban (which is quite high for Douban). Through these two works, I truly understand: Childishness and naivety must not be confused, and the emotional core is the essence, regardless of the external form. In the end, the highest emotional intelligence is often sincerity. Other Thoughts Freedom and happiness are born from restraints. Is the life of a leaf meant to fall, or to nourish? The fate of the Clan of Parting is linked to their hair; they cannot form bonds with freedom mothers. Maternal love. Single mothers don’t cry; the significance of children to mothers is life. The middle section’s grand battle and childbirth scenes are breathtaking. Destruction and rebirth are captured in the lenses. A world of sadness and pain; love is a curse, encounters are a curse that makes one lonely. Buddhism teaches us to let go of everything, but only by experiencing can we truly let go. In the middle, a knight says, “Ancient creatures are destined to perish.” I believe this represents the outdated ideas (notions) of the Clan of Parting will disappear. They have truly experienced the parting of the mortal world, understood the pain, and also felt happiness.

In contrast, “Penguin Highway” offers a child’s perspective. Morimi once edited an anthology of short stories by Osamu Dazai titled “Kisho to Egao.” He admitted that rather than being influenced by Dazai’s famous works like “No Longer Human” or “The Setting Sun,” it was Dazai’s humorous writing and engaging dialogue that left a more significant mark on him.

Relationship diagram (spoilers about the sea’s properties are omitted)\rThe assistant is both a beneficiary and a predator of the “sea,” forming a miniature ecosystem. Professor Wang Peng interprets this as a reflection of “the coexistence of truth and fallacy,” suggesting that “the assistant embodies truth.” Hence, the protagonist’s admiration for her symbolizes an admiration for truth—enigmatic and distant. Despite his precociousness, Aoyama remains a child. Ultimately, due to the sea’s instability, the assistant chooses to destroy it, sacrificing herself to prevent the sea from overwhelming the town. “The sea” becomes a truth known only to Aoyama. It serves as his rite of passage, guiding him toward exploring the world. I agree with Professor Wang Peng: The assistant embodies beauty and mystery, making Aoyama, the “explorer,” instinctively develop feelings for her. However, I believe it is equally vital to recognize that “Penguin Highway” is a coming-of-age story: Initially, Aoyama feared losing his baby teeth. One night, his younger sister expressed her fear that “someday, Mom might die.” From that moment, Aoyama’s transformation became more pronounced. With the assistant’s help, he courageously overcame his fear of losing a tooth. Ultimately, he accepts the assistant’s sacrifice, signifying his growth. Through this journey, Aoyama becomes braver and transitions from pure scientific reasoning to a more emotional perspective, grounded in a belief in science and the courage to confront growth. The assistant provides him with a new way of seeing the world. The assistant’s final disappearance…\rThe assistant serves as a “guide.” Every child may have such a figure in their heart—someone who grows old and eventually leaves. While it brings sorrow, it also teaches acceptance and growth, shaping the child into a better adult. The film is incredibly gentle, frequently hinting that “the sea” represents the world’s end. This concept reshapes Aoyama’s worldview, becoming a part of his growth. Since the assistant is not human, her disappearance at the end leaves room for interpretation about the “sea” and its connection to the world’s end. A fantasy film grounded in science, mended with warmth and growth, “Penguin Highway” charts a unique path. So, what lies at the end of the Penguin Highway? It is the silhouette of a boy running, exploring amidst loss, and ultimately growing into an exceptional adult. Keep running, along the Penguin Highway, until you reach the world’s end!

The autumnal atmosphere of Beijing is often particularly intense, for this land brims with profound history. Ancient capitals of the Jin, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties rose upon this soil; the smoke of war from Beiping lingers long without dissipating; countless heroes and sages have halted here, leaving behind silhouettes that the world reveres—and the great standard-bearer of the New Culture Movement, Lu Xun, also left a brilliant mark in Beijing. No. 19, Fuchengmen Ertiao—this was my first stop upon coming to Beijing during my university years: Lu Xun’s Former Residence. I wondered with what state of mind this great literary master came to the flourishing city of Beijing? What manner of scenery would the former residence of such a lifelong vanguard of the pen hold? The exhibition hall sits within a hutong (narrow alleyway), secluded and tranquil. I entered from a bustling commercial street, possessing a certain sense of “a winding path leading to a secluded retreat,” much like the profound connotations under Lu Xun’s literary brushwork. Perhaps to avoid excessively disturbing the legacy left by the master, the hutong has remained largely unchanged. Beside it stand plump birds scattered here and there; the crisscrossing network of hutong lanes maintains its antique appearance, with clothes drying openly on all sides and motorcycles parked around. I imagine that were Mr. Lu Xun alive today, he would be pleased to witness such harmonious development. Heroes dedicated themselves to peace, and this is precisely the tranquility they prayed for. The tiled houses flanking the ancient main gate are covered in moss, while towering trees provide shelter amidst the autumn wind, as if Mr. Lu Xun were still extending welcoming arms to visitors. Such scenery and atmosphere readily bring to mind secluded dwellings like “Zhuge’s Thatched Cottage” and “The Humble Room Inscription.” The above description can hardly be called baseless association; in fact, many visitors, before even stepping through the gate, begin plotting photographs beside the tall trees and tiled houses. 如图\rAfter making an online reservation for the exhibition, one can enter by displaying a health code and ID card. There is not a single fee charged—a true display of Beijing’s generosity. Lu Xun and Guo Moruo The plaque “Lu Xun Former Residence” was written by Guo Moruo. It seems Mr. Guo Moruo truly traveled far and wide—the calligraphy of our three famous local universities also originated from his brush. Interestingly, “From afar it looks like a dog, up close it looks like a Japanese dog, upon closer inspection, it turns out to be Mr. Guo Moruo.” This remark is rumored to be Lu Xun’s evaluation of this “talent and rogue.” Whether it is authentic can no longer be verified, but after verification, the former residence in Shanghai was actually also inscribed by Mr. Guo Moruo, so personally I feel the probability that Mr. Lu Xun actually said that evaluation should be quite small. Entering the courtyard, I was surprised to find it so intimate? The first things to catch one’s eye are two plump orange cats, quietly enjoying the crowd’s adoration, occasionally stretching lazily and sauntering a few steps. The solemn former residence instantly became intimate and approachable. Thinking about it, although Mr. Lu Xun originally gave people a serious impression, his lovable qualities were by no means few—could works like “Old Tales Retold” be written by someone with a dry and insipid soul? 如图\rThe main exhibition hall has two floors, above ground and below, using Lu Xun’s life timeline as its thread, roughly divided into several stages. Each exhibition room unfolds continuously according to Mr. Lu Xun’s original writings. At the very front stands a large white wall with simple patterns, upon which that famous quotation is engraved: “Originally there were no paths in this world; but as more people walked, paths were formed.” T","date":"2020-12-19","objectID":"/en/posts/lxgj/:0:0","tags":["Travel","Microhistory"],"title":"Lu Xun's Former Residence: The Sole Light","uri":"/en/posts/lxgj/"},{"categories":null,"content":"About HXS Reasons to use blogs: I want to try to build my own website I want to leave a little mark on the world Zhihu writes notes, but actually restricts off-site reference links Bottom line: A Libra who is learning the quadratic of economics, trying to gauge the intriguing and deep.
