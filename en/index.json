This book is actually a popular science introduction to the mathematics of economics for mathematics students. The interesting disciplinary stance is that mathematicians generally try to avoid normative analysis in social sciences and non-mathematical explanations of terms. Reading Difficulty: Intermediate microeconomics level, but since it is aimed at mathematics students, some parts exceed intermediate level. For example, intermediate microeconomics usually introduces Arrow‚Äôs Impossibility Theorem using tables, while this book directly uses functional analysis. Disciplinary History: This book can be seen as a history of the development of mathematics in economics. Many people finish studying microeconomics without understanding the development of mathematical tools. For example, many only know a couple of example problems from textbooks about the contributions of Cournot, Walras, and Arrow. The history of the discipline fills in the gaps, helping to understand the inheritance process of these masters. As I mentioned in The Arrogance of Economics: Some Recent Thoughts, I believe that learning the history of a discipline is very important. Understanding the history of the integration of mathematics and economics is also crucial. If you haven‚Äôt experienced the beauty of intermediate level, it‚Äôs hard to go far by immersing yourself in advanced mathematical techniques. Because economic thought is already fully permeated at the intermediate level, the advanced level is just a precise expression and generalization of the intermediate models. Reviewing the biographies of economists is actually quite interesting. Just as people are obsessed with commenting on contemporary economists and gossiping about the career moves of academic stars, in the history of mathematical economics, you can also see many familiar names who were once obscure in their papers until their contributions were later recognized. Ideology: In that era, using mathematical tools to analyze economics was considered to have a capitalist flavor. The book is full of this era-specific characteristic, with the author having to emphasize that they are critically viewing it and inserting discussions on Soviet socialist mathematical economics. This historical atmosphere feels quite novel to me üòÇ.

William Petty (William Petty) ‚ÄúPolitical Arithmetic‚Äù. This was the beginning of using numbers. 19th Century. Use of Functions: Cournot (Charles-Fran√ßois Gounod)1 (student of Paris Normal School, student of Laplace and Poisson) ‚ÄúMathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth‚Äù. Many could not accept the mathematical expression of the price-demand function in the book, so Cournot wrote another version avoiding mathematics (but it still didn‚Äôt become popular). His contributions were only recognized 80 years after his death. Pioneers of Marginal Analysis: Gossen (Hermann Heinrich Gossen)2 was not accepted in his time because his mathematics was too advanced. The founder of the Austrian School, Menger (Carl Menger), who did not know calculus, described marginal analysis using intuition, which had a great influence. The Austrian School thereafter had few economists who actively used mathematics. Jevons (William Stanley Jevons) ‚ÄúA Brief Statement of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy‚Äù (1862), Walras (L√©on Walras) (founder of the Lausanne School) ‚ÄúElements of Pure Economics‚Äù. Both knew calculus, Walras was better at mathematics than Jevons. Menger, Jevons, and Walras all independently developed marginal analysis, but they later found that Gossen was the earliest, though he was not recognized. Expansion of Mathematical Models: Walras‚Äôs general equilibrium theory emerged. It proved the existence of prices that balance market supply and demand. However, Walras‚Äôs mathematics was not good enough; he thought that if the number of variables equals the number of equations, there would be a solution, without considering the rank of the equation system. Although the proof was not rigorous, the idea still had a profound impact. Von Neumann also thought about game theory based on general equilibrium. 80 years after Walras proposed the general equilibrium theory, Debreu (G√©rard Debreu) ‚ÄúTheory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium‚Äù (1959) strictly proved the existence of general equilibrium. It is a necessary and sufficient condition with the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. Second Generation of Marginal Utility School: Edgeworth ‚ÄúMathematical Psychics‚Äù, Marshall ‚ÄúPrinciples of Economics‚Äù (Marshall (Alfred Marshall)3 also had a mathematics background, representing the Cambridge School). Keynes (John Maynard Keynes)4 was a student of Marshall. Second Generation of Lausanne School: Pareto (Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto) (worked as a railway mining engineer for 20 years). American Marginal School: Fisher5 (Irving Fisher) inspired Keynes. Austrian School Follow-up: Menger‚Äôs son became a mathematician and brought out two important figures, one being G√∂del (G√∂del) of the incompleteness theorem, and the other being the statistician Wald (wald)6 (Wald test in econometrics). Schumpeter (Joseph Alois Schumpeter), though born in the Austrian School, had theories that almost dominated the field. The protagonist of the 2018 National Volume 2 essay question is Wald. Unfortunately, Wald died in a plane crash.\rThe most famous mathematical method in macroeconomics is control theory, which was formed by a group of free-spirited scientists in Vienna, including von Neumann. The first to seriously introduce control theory into economics was Alan Blinder (Alan Stuart Blinder). Earlier introductions of control theory are more commonly known through Phillips (Phillips)7.

Shi Shuzhong‚Äôs words are thought-provoking‚Äîthe significance of choosing a research object is determined by the research results, not by arguing with others. You should study whatever object you want, and it‚Äôs best to accept the test, but the choice of research object should not be constrained. Do not be overly constrained by terms like xx-ism, xx school, xx needs, xx practice. The part of economics that frequently uses mathematics is empirical economics. But it is necessary to distinguish the goals of using mathematics, because many people hope that economics can achieve the same predictive power as physics through mathematics. But take physiology as an example, although we can dissect the heart, no one expects it to predict the heartbeat. The role of economics should be to cooperate with empirical analysis to form clear axiomatic expressions.

Dual problem. Profit maximization and cost minimization are dual problems. Continuous iteration and calculus may lead to some more important transformations. Cardinal utility theory is difficult to generalize, while ordinal utility theory is easier and can prove that cardinal utility theory has a corresponding suitable ordinal utility theory. Prisoner‚Äôs dilemma inspiration: local optimum does not equal global optimum, the key is not to be too dispersed, otherwise it is easy to fight internally. Arrow‚Äôs Impossibility Theorem is aÁΩëÁ∫¢ theorem, many people like to hang a title‚Äîmathematics proves that democracy is impossible. Buchanan developed public choice theory based on this, criticizing the effectiveness of collective decision-making. However, the contributor Arrow himself was very cautious: The philosophical and distributive implications of social choice contradictions are not clear, and there is certainly no simple way to resolve them. ‚Äî Arrow Edgeworth Box: The exchange process is not necessarily equal, this is an equal opportunity, at every Pareto optimal point, the distribution between the two parties can easily be unequal, but the opportunity to achieve any result is equal. This reflects that procedural justice may be more important than outcome justice. Uncertain environments can help us determine cardinal utility theory. Shi Shuzhong approaches the macro part from the perspective of engineering control. The blogger ‚ÄâSong recommended ‚ÄúCybernetics and Scientific Methodology‚Äù to me. In fact, some foreign universities in macroeconomics also require students to study control theory and dynamical systems. Walras and Pareto also received training in this area. Macro systems need to consider input, output, transfer, feedback, goal achievement, and optimal path (flowchart). Ordinary differential equations are closely related to control theory. If society is seen as a system, then the market is a regulator. For example, the following differential equations reflect the relationship between wage-product ratio and employment rate. $$ \\begin{cases} \\dot{\\varepsilon}=-{\\varepsilon }h\\left( \\theta \\right)\\\\ \\dot{\\theta}=-{\\theta }g\\left( \\varepsilon \\right) \\end{cases} $$ Mathematically, it is a nonlinear Volterra equation. Initially, it described the ecosystem at the bottom of a lake, where big fish eat small fish, but when the small fish are eaten up, the big fish also find it difficult to survive, eventually reaching an equilibrium. (Therefore, the New Cambridge School believes that this equation is like class struggle.)

I feel that the controversy lies in what is called economic intuition. For example, in this foreign exam question, you are first asked to calculate, then to think intuitively after calculating. At this point, mathematics and economic reasoning complement each other. Question source: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PycYJ6QKeRSYQl9jVeNexlqtKBFlwxpl/view\rWhat is economic intuition? Is there really so-called counter-intuitive research? My current feeling is that intuition is the grasp of the trend of factor changes. Roughly knowing the direction of influence and weight of a factor in the market system. I also agree with a sentence from ‚ÄúThe Origin of Wealth‚Äù: The most wonderful part of science is that it seems incredible before analysis, but after analysis, it seems inevitable. Many people quote Marx‚Äôs saying‚ÄîA science is only truly perfected when it successfully applies mathematics. Actually, this sentence appears in Lafargue‚Äôs memoirs, where Lafargue said that Marx said this. Marx did not express this view in his own works. However, Marx‚Äôs mathematics at least reached Taylor expansion. Interestingly, although Marx learned some calculus, he did not realize that his theory of differential rent had the idea of marginal analysis. Marx also believed that the mystification tendency of mathematics was one of the reasons for its development. This can be found in ‚ÄúMarx‚Äôs Mathematical Manuscripts.‚Äù The successful mathematics in economics is actually an abstraction of the essence of phenomena. Through scientific abstraction, the internal mechanism of things is revealed. Can we achieve qualitative analysis without quantitative analysis? Although Adam Smith directly conducted qualitative analysis, after mathematization, people understood Adam Smith‚Äôs qualitative analysis more clearly. The journey from vague text to rigorous mathematical description is a long one, measured in centuries. The classic Cournot model in microeconomics discusses a type of duopoly game.

Of course, the best society is not one where people dream physiologically, but one where everyone dares to dream of ideals.

Lucid Dreams: Being in overlapping white staircases, realizing it‚Äôs a dream, but still unable to control it, just walking blindly. Recurring Dreams: From elementary to middle school, I repeatedly dreamed of walking on the ridges of southern water fields in my hometown. There was a chest-deep pit in the path, and falling into it, I could feel the slithering sensation of giant pythons around me.

A relative girl poured loaches into the basin where I had placed water. I suddenly became agitated, remembering that there was a small snake I had raised in it. I frantically reminded the relative not to squeeze out my pet snake. As the water filled up, the snake disappeared. I felt that this was the second time I had lost a pet snake, but I couldn‚Äôt recall the first time‚Äîonly the painful feeling of loss. I kept trying to convince my family that such a snake had existed (I was using the past tense to describe it, which might be a key point). On a stone table in the classic neighborhood grove, I kept telling them all my memories, but could only recall some vague landmarks. I searched everywhere, retrieving memories from the trash bin, the police station, and the museum. Trash Bin Memory: On my way to school, I found a transparent small box inside a larger box, containing a talking snake! I also remembered that the trash bin was divided into recyclable and non-recyclable, a world that seemed omnipotent. She was actually a talking snake. The snake and I watched videos andÂêêÊßΩ together. But I couldn‚Äôt remember how it came to be, only fragmented memories of life. Police Station: I was parentless, driving a second-hand Changan truck collecting garbage. The Changan‚Äôs window was broken, patched with yellow tape, and the trunk couldn‚Äôt lock, so I propped it open with a support to load junk and goods. The snake turned out to be a descendant of Bai Suzhen‚Äôs lineage, an experimental subject. I was caught in the pursuit of an evil force, and the police were helping me. Museum: The evil force was conducting biological experiments in pursuit of mythical power. The snake sacrificed itself to save me, incidentally erasing my memory.

You mentioned that this was the ‚Äúsecond time‚Äù you lost the pet snake but couldn‚Äôt recall the first time, which might hint at a past experience of loss that was very painful for you. Trash Bin Memory: This part seems to suggest that you found something precious (the talking snake) in an unexpected place, symbolizing the value you find in ordinary or overlooked things. The ‚Äúrecyclable and non-recyclable‚Äù world might represent your views on resource utilization or your attempt to give new meaning to seemingly useless things in life. Police Station Scene: The image of driving a second-hand Changan truck collecting garbage might be a self-deprecating or humble reflection of your life status. The pursuit and police assistance could reflect the pressures or challenges you face in real life and your need for external help. Museum Memory: This involves mythological elements (like Bai Suzhen) and scientific experiments, as well as the act of choosing to forget to protect others. This might indicate that you are facing similar choices in real life‚Äîsometimes having to make sacrifices or give up something for the safety and happiness of yourself or others. Overall Dream Structure: The entire dream seems like a story about growth, responsibility, love, and sacrifice. It might be telling you that despite the many difficulties and uncertainties in life, you have the strength to face them, and sometimes you must accept certain events, even if it means enduring some loss. Of course, this is just a general analysis based on the dream content you provided. Everyone‚Äôs experiences are unique, so the most accurate understanding should come from yourself.

This snake can talk, help youÂêêÊßΩ, solve problems, and even sacrifice itself to protect you, showing that it is not just a pet but also a spiritual companion or guide. Loss and Search In the dream, you keep losing and searching for the snake, which might hint at the loss of some important emotion or memory in reality. This repeated loss and retrieval might correspond to a process of losing and trying to regain yourself in a certain situation. Trash Bin, Police Station, and Museum These locations each have deep meanings: Trash Bin: Symbolizes parts of life that are neglected or discarded.

In The Lion King, Kung Fu Panda, and The Legend of the White Snake, snakes are portrayed positively, and there‚Äôs an ancient saying about snakes transforming into dragons. Talking Snake: Recently, I had a lot of discussions with classmates during a gathering, and writing my thesis also requires active communication with the team.

What determines the development path of a state? I often use this question as an example in my blog1‚Äîwhat is the origin of government? One school of thought is classical political economy, represented by social contract theory, public goods theory2, and social welfare theory. The establishment of a power collective stems from the need for collective optimization. Of course, how to measure social welfare is itself a philosophical question. Minimum (veil of ignorance thought experiment3)? Maximum? Mean? Absolute value? Marginal value? Designing a weighted convex function? Beyond that, the values of justice are also philosophical issues, such as Amartya Sen‚Äôs freedom of choice; the average outcome of planned economies; the average initial distribution of endowments‚Ä¶ Setting taxes is like the trolley problem: one track has the poor, another has the middle class, and another has the rich‚Äîeven the driver must consider that some might turn into Super Saiyans and flip the table before being hit. Before introducing another school of thought, let‚Äôs look at the next question‚Äîwhat determines the development of a state. One major school of thought is the resource endowment theory from the perspective of international trade. Country A has 4 units of resource A and 2 units of resource B, but industry A is more profitable, so it naturally chooses industry A. Country B has only 0.5 units of resource A and 1 unit of resource B, so industry B is more profitable, and it develops industry B. Quantity of Resource A Quantity of Resource B More Profitable Industry Choice Country A 4 2 A Country B 0.5 1 B Thus, even though Country A is stronger in all resources compared to Country B, it chooses industry A because it is more profitable internally. Similarly, Country B chooses industry B. This model (H-O comparative advantage) vividly explains why weaker countries with lower absolute advantages can still export goods to stronger countries. Professor Lin Yifu proposed ‚ÄúNew Structural Economics‚Äù based on this idea. The Origin of International Trade First stage view: Absolute advantage Second stage view: Comparative advantage Third stage view: Scale effect Fourth stage view: Heterogeneous firms In other words, this school of thought assumes that national development is determined by regional resources. The following distinctions about institutional economics are based on ‚ÄúInstitutions and Economic Growth‚Äù (Yao Yang), a book about the dialogue between Professor Yao Yang and institutional economics master North. (Haven‚Äôt finished reading it yet, will supplement later.) Institutional economics does not agree with this view. For example, North believes that investment, education, and capital accumulation are not the causes of economic growth but rather manifestations of growth. If simply stacking production factors could lead to development, theoretically, all countries could imitate it, but reality is not like that. In fact, efficient organizations are the main drivers of development. At the same time, the resource endowment theory assumes that people will rationally maximize their resource advantages. A simple counterexample is the partial trend of deglobalization. Example 1. Coase used transaction costs to explain the origin of firms‚Äîexplaining the emergence of firms from an institutional perspective. This shows that the emergence of institutions has commonalities, rather than resource endowments creating special orders. Example 2. I prefer to use an anthropological perspective to explain institutional economics‚Äîour cultural behaviors can be seen as over-ritualization4. For example, preserved meat was a New Year‚Äôs food in the past because it was easy to preserve, a behavior born out of resource constraints. But now, with abundant resources, preserved meat has become a symbol of New Year‚Äôs cuisine. Example 3.

We are studying a class of mapping functions, or in other words, ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù means the object of study is a function of functions; nonlinear functionals are a form of path optimization, which can be referenced in another blog post ‚ÄúCalculus of Variations Study Notes‚Äù. Some advanced microeconomic reasoning relies on sets as the space for decision elements: Let the set of social individuals be $I=\\{ 1,2,\\ldots,n \\}, n\\geqslant2$. $x,y \\in X$ are resource sets, allocated to individuals $a_i$, i.e., $\\sum_i^n a_i=X_i$. Preferences are as follows. $x\\succeq_{i}y$ : Individual $i$ considers $x$ no worse than $y$. $x\\sim_{i}y$ : Individual $i$ considers $x$ and $y$ indifferent. $x\\succ_{i}y$ : Individual $i$ considers $x$ better than $y$. As mentioned earlier, a functional is a mapping from space to space. A social welfare functional is a mapping from the space of individual joint preferences to the space of social preferences, denoted as $$ \\succeq^{F}=F(\\succeq_{1},\\succeq_{2},\\ldots,\\succeq_{n}) $$ Note, this is a mapping from the preference space of all individuals to social preferences, not necessarily a one-dimensional space ($R^1$). The joint preference space of individuals can be understood as the set of all individuals‚Äô preference outcomes, and the social preference space can be understood as the final overall preference outcome space we should acknowledge. Next, let‚Äôs illustrate with examples: For a dictatorial society, social preferences are forced to conform to the preferences of one individual. $$ x\\succ_{h}y\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x\\succ y $$ Majority voting is a mapping where the minority follows the majority, comparing based on the aggregation of similar individual preferences. $$ N(x\\succ_{i}y)\u003eN(y\\succ_{i}x)\\Rightarrow\\quad x\\succ y $$ $$ N(x\\succ_{i}y)=N(y\\succ_{i}x)\\Rightarrow\\quad x\\sim y $$ May‚Äôs Theorem: The necessary and sufficient conditions for a social welfare functional to be majority voting are the following three properties: Anonymity of majority voting means that the sequence identifiers $i$ within the same preference can be interchanged; Neutrality means that each person‚Äôs vote has the same weight; Positive responsiveness means that the direction of social preference change is the same as the direction of change in some individuals‚Äô preferences. Majority voting sounds ideal, but real-world voting encounters various problems. For details, see ‚ÄúVoting Paradox‚Äù (also known as the Condorcet Paradox). Since preferences are based on ordinal utility theory, they are comparative. It is possible to have an infinite loop of comparisons. Real-world voting is more complex, such as swing states being key in U.S. elections, and the mentality of bandwagoning and retaliation also affects voting results. Source: Wikipedia\rTherefore, we need to set axiomatic conditions for social welfare functionals: Unrestricted Domain: Each individual preference can be reflected in social preferences (social preferences must at least satisfy transitivity and completeness). Non-dictatorship: Supplement: The anonymity principle is a stronger constraint than non-dictatorship. Pareto Principle: $\\forall i\\in A, x\\succ_{i}y \\rightarrow x\\succ y$ Independence: $\\forall x, y\\in X$ when $x\\succ y$ holds, any $i\\in I$‚Äôs preference on the complement of $\\{x, y\\}$ does not affect the social preference result $x\\succ y$. Independence is actually to make the model more concise, limiting the information voters consider to the current choice, a weaker constraint than neutrality. At this point, we can propose a voting scheme‚ÄîBorda Count. The core is ranking, where each person ranks each option from 1 to n, $c_i(x)$, with better options ranked higher. Finally, sum the ranks for each option. $$ c(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}(x) $$ The smaller ","date":"2024-11-17","objectID":"/en/posts/shxz/:2:1","tags":["Institutional Economics","Microeconomics"],"title":"Institutions, Politics, Democracy","uri":"/en/posts/shxz/"},{"categories":["Economic Studies"],"content":"Arrow‚Äôs Impossibility Theorem ","date":"2024-11-17","objectID":"/en/posts/shxz/:3:0","tags":["Institutional Economics","Microeconomics"],"title":"Institutions, Politics, Democracy","uri":"/en/posts/shxz/"},{"categories":["Economic Studies"],"content":"Decisive Coalition We have many expectations for collective decision-making, so we wonder if there is a voting method that can satisfy all our demands.

Given Arrow‚Äôs Impossibility Theorem, Why Does Microeconomics Still Study Social Welfare Functions? Personal understanding: You can think of the dictatorship proof in Arrow‚Äôs Impossibility Theorem as the ‚Äúlast vote‚Äù that tips the scale. But the understanding needs to go deeper: Remember: Arrow‚Äôs Impossibility Theorem studies the mapping from individual preference space to social preference space. Because Arrow wants to solve the best mapping from individual preference space to social preference space, the most ideal democracy is one where there is no ‚Äútipping vote.‚Äù Absolute equality, where participation is through ranking rather than cardinal utility aggregation. Of course, there are already theorems proving the existence of transformations between ordinal and cardinal preferences. Assuming everyone votes once under unknown circumstances, there will always be one person whose preference determines (even if they don‚Äôt know they are the dictator of this game) the entire society‚Äôs preference, making the vote dictatorial. In other words, the mapping is not ideal and does not truly reflect the preferences of the majority. Assuming multi-stage games, people may change their votes based on retaliation, altering their preferences, which violates the independence assumption. If everyone changes their initial preferences to win, the mapping no longer reflects the best outcome. Ultimately, Arrow‚Äôs Impossibility Theorem aims to prove this point‚Äîmapping individual preferences to social preferences is fraught with difficulties.

A perfect story needs a curtain call, a prophecy of the ending state rather than just a summary of the past, which can be extended. Texts lacking actions and states do not qualify as stories.

Thus, science, literature, and art intersect rather than oppose each other in the traditional sense. Personally, I reserve my opinion on this. Economic arguments employ the following argumentative methods: The first three points are from British scientific argumentation. From a literary perspective, the author expands these to more points. Statistical tests, specific market analysis, experiments on theories, introspection (What would I do if xx happened?), thought experiments (Based on experience, what would others do in xx situations?), case studies, folk wisdom (merchants), traditional academic knowledge, symmetry of laws (e.g., defining glorious periods and garbage periods), pure definitions, analogies‚Ä¶ For example, economic papers do not describe the motion of objects but depict human behavior, which aligns with literary creation.

To make research questions engaging, the book emphasizes both contemporary issues and contradictions arising from existing theories. Rather than innovation, I appreciate the way the ideas are presented. The book examines Beijing‚Äôs ‚ÄúZhejiang Village.‚Äù Despite being a cosmopolitan city, Beijing has a self-organized Zhejiang Village. This village is not a natural settlement or administrative entity, but a gathering point for Zhejiang immigrants. Xiang Biao‚Äôs theoretical framework is outlined as follows: Here is a note for studying the narrative logic of literature reviews. Phenomenon Characteristic: The village is a self-organized gathering point for Zhejiang immigrants in Beijing. This belongs to the issue of population movement. Theoretical Summarization: Existing theories suggest that population movement tends towards modernity from tradition. Xiang Biao summarizes various theories2 into a ‚Äútradition-modernity‚Äù framework, where these theories perceive tradition and modernity as being in a contradictory relationship. Theoretical Review: Coexistence, dependence, and embedding are three relations that can explain phenomena where backward and developed areas appear simultaneously due to population movement. However, coexistence theory lacks depth, dependency theory only touches on division of labor, and embedding theory addresses social structure without detailing its formation. Theoretical Contradiction: The process of community embedding has not been fully researched. Therefore, the paper focuses on social networks under population movement, studying the interplay of social networks, trust, and community formation as key to understanding Zhejiang Village‚Äôs emergence. New Theory Proposed: Emphasizing social network analysis, a series of theories already carry this idea3. Indeed, Xiang Biao‚Äôs theoretical views are quite similar to Yang Xiaokai‚Äôs Neoclassical Economics, though one explains communities and the other markets. The core logic revolves around these two points: A person appears independent, but when many connect, a market emerges, and individuals are influenced by social networks rather than acting independently. This logic chain‚Äîunseen hand-market economy-web model-general equilibrium-community formation‚Äîis summarized by Xiang Biao as ‚Äúthe fracture between the whole and the particular,‚Äù which may seem abstract, but essentially illustrates the internal contradiction of individual independence versus the collective‚Äôs dominance. Since social networks are always composed of people, we can analyze the entire social network through individual decision-making. This viewpoint is shared by Yang Xiaokai, Xiang Biao, and classical Bayesian network models, all emphasizing their theories that open the black box of the formation process while completing retrospective and unit analysis tasks ü§™. Yang Xiaokai‚Äôs marginal analysis focuses on consumer-producer individual general equilibrium, while Xiang Biao centers on relationships between individuals. In the ‚ÄúThirteen Invitations,‚Äù Xiang Biao discusses the ‚Äúdisappearance of proximity‚Äù because he consistently advocates this market theory of individuals and social networks. The key difference lies in the fact that Yang Xiaokai builds upon Adam Smith‚Äôs division of labor creating wealth theory, starting from decision-making in labor division; Xiang Biao focuses on relationships forming a general equilibrium.

However, social sciences, as seen in „ÄäCrossing Boundaries of Community„Äã, involve a more comprehensive scanning of scenarios, aiming for a richer depiction of human experiences, leading to a more encompassing understanding of the world5. I recall a classmate being astonished upon seeing a social science dissertation filled with everyday records‚Äîhow could such mundane, unfiltered observations be considered academic work? Yet, sociology transforms self-awareness into consciousness. As Sherlock Holmes‚Äô adventures highlight, it‚Äôs about observing, not just looking. When we review each chapter of „ÄäCrossing Boundaries of Community„Äã individually, everyday trivialities might seem mundane. Everyone understands that post-reform entrepreneurship, institutional execution can be chaotic, and markets are driven by relationships. However, stitching together all chapters, Xiang Biao subtly constructs his ‚Äúprotruding facts.‚Äù Individual Traits: Zhejiang merchants prioritize relationships over kinship, valuing movement and entrepreneurship. Clothing technology spreads outward through kinship relationships. These ethical traits contribute to Zhejiang Village‚Äôs expanding social network and cultural characteristics. This process transforms individual characteristics into entrepreneurial, sales, industrial, market, and ultimately community relations6, from isolated individual action to collective movement. State Interaction: Why can‚Äôt states or eras alone explain Zhejiang Village‚Äôs formation? Zhejiang Village has its own framework, gradually marketizing, where many merchants accumulated wealth independently, rather than directly benefiting from reform. Zhejiang Village repeatedly clashed with Beijing‚Äôs administration, expanding through institutional reform, demonstrating its autonomous order. Through this relational perspective, more can be explained‚Äîsystemic interactions, policy versus counteractions, class and tiered divisions, top-down interventions versus grassroots responses. This goes beyond mere mechanical opposition, delving into complex interactions driven by identity, rendering simplistic labels of advanced or backward meaningless, focusing instead on internal behavior and decision-making processes. This theory leans heavily towards liberalism‚Äîspontaneous order7 is disrupted by excessive intervention, and rather than control, understanding and acceptance are essential8. Entry Point: Xiang Biao didn‚Äôt begin with the intricate relationships shaping communities; his research initially focused on Zhejiang Village‚Äôs garment industry development. Over time, his studies unearthed relationships influencing community formation. Even discovering relationships was straightforward. China has traditionally been considered a society of interpersonal networks, but articulating community origins through relationships and population movement provides a mature narrative perspective.

Zhejiang Village, in its resistance to state governance, lacks a corporate enterprise model but thrives with unconventional vitality. Imagine if we were residents of Zhejiang Village, could we easily identify these traits? Alienation is a powerful analytical tool! However, this raises methodological debates‚Äîwhat role should researchers take when entering research subjects? How should they alienate the environment? Xiang Biao opposes abstract generalization, instead aiming to provide rational explanations through daily phenomena, crafting a self-organized order for Zhejiang Village. His inclusiveness and willingness to rationalize are admirable, but it reflects a moral choice‚Äîaccepting phenomena and attempting to rationalize them. Constructing forward-thinking moral frameworks is difficult. Is there truly rational absurdity? Who decides which phenomena are absurd? These questions remain elusive, possibly contributing to why social sciences are not universally recognized as scientific.

During the summer solstice, it receives no fewer than 13 hours of sunlight. The flowering period has little rain, abundant sunshine, which is conducive to the formation and accumulation of aromatic oil. The soil has a thick humus layer, slightly acidic, with high content of trace elements such as iron, manganese, copper, and zinc.

The Wo Hu Mountain Great Wall, part of the Ming Dynasty‚Äôs construction, is unique for its circular beacon towers1. The owner of the guesthouse2 gave directions to my classmates on how to reach the Wall, and I decided to join them for the sunrise. We set off at 3 a.m., walking along the national highway beside the guesthouse. After spotting a tourism signpost, we found Yang Qilang‚Äôs tomb and temple nearby. Passing through the temple, we reached a dirt path leading into the mountains. The stone-brick road of the Great Wall was mostly in ruins, with only the bricks near the beacon towers remaining relatively intact. Starting from this point was particularly memorable because of the presence of a train tunnel. The first relatively complete beacon tower we arrived at. Around 4 o‚Äôclock, the sky was already glowing red.\rBecause we needed time for the door-to-door survey, we ended our climb at the third-to-last beacon tower. It was around four o‚Äôclock then. Climbing all the way up would take about an hour and a half, while descending would be much faster, less than an hour. I haven‚Äôt climbed many mountains, and before this, I had only watched the sunrise once on Mount Emei. Watching the sunrise on Mount Emei feels like forging iron3. The sea of clouds at the peak rolls like icy rivers, and suddenly, a spark of the sun pierces through the shroud, creating a hole in the canvas. In an instant, the sea of clouds boils, and the flowing mist splashes around, much like the steaming heat during iron forging. Paired with the golden, gleaming Buddha at the summit, it feels like a celestial realm. Watching the sunrise from the mountainside of Wo Hu Mountain, the sun is initially blocked by the distant peaks, making the process slower and more nurturing.

Personal Reflections: Addressing climate change is indeed urgent. Gubei Water Town is blessed with ample water resources, with most of its land being irrigated fields, including many paddy fields. However, villagers reported that since 2018, the water levels have been declining annually, leading to many irrigated fields being converted into forested areas due to the decreasing water levels. The suburbs of Beijing aren‚Äôt much different from my hometown. It is generally believed that poorer areas tend to favor sons over daughters, but here, due to men‚Äôs jobs being insufficient to support a family and the bride price system, people actually feel it‚Äôs better to have daughters. The attitude of the residents reflects the quality of governance. In areas with rampant corruption, villagers clearly distrusted us, feeling that despite all the surveys, nothing changes: ‚ÄúWe common folks, no matter how much we talk, it doesn‚Äôt help.‚Äù In well-governed areas with good welfare, every response was filled with gratitude towards the state, with villagers willing to comply with any government directives. I realized I am indeed quite careless! My fellow classmates, especially the female students, were much more meticulous than I was. Their questionnaire filling and reviewing were more rigorous, and I should learn from them. Survey Methods: Elderly party members and enthusiastic grandmothers make the best interviewees‚Äîthey are attentive, sincere, and willing to actively cooperate with door-to-door surveys. When it comes to income-related surveys, respondents often understate their wealth. In such cases, it is important to observe the room (decoration, presence of a car, size, quality of furniture, etc.) and learn to ask disaggregated questions. For example, break down farming into the yield per mu, the number of mu farmed, and the price per jin. Similarly, use cross-verification by asking unexpected questions. For instance, when calculating income and expenses separately, ensure they balance. For household expenses, consider the number of family members and their consumption. When respondents are uncertain, set ranges‚Äîdo you have 100 yuan? 200 yuan? The answers to questions can easily be manipulated. For example, asking if villagers come together to discuss solutions when faced with difficulties will invariably get a positive response. However, asking specific questions reveals more. After a recent storm in Beijing knocked down trees in many parks and schools, asking about the storm‚Äôs impact on their fields and if they sought collective solutions will likely reveal that everyone managed their own fields independently. Village-household integration. When implementing subsidy programs at the village level, the approach is often straightforward and crude. For example, the distinction between reforestation and ecological public welfare forests is blurred for villagers, who view both as tree planting for money. Subsidies are divided into planting subsidies and other types, but in the village, they are distributed together, making farmers think they get money just for planting. To address this, policies need to be broken down and explained in conjunction with villagers‚Äô responses. Praise should be moderate. Each questionnaire typically takes about an hour5. To ensure cooperation, we often praise the respondents during the interview. However, if the praise is excessive, some attitudinal questions may receive overly positive responses, distorting the results. Moreover, for questions about marital harmony or neighborly relations, unless asked about neighbors, personal responses tend to be uniformly positive.

Some Problems and Solutions Authors: Jiafeng Chen; Jonathan Roth Journal: The Quarterly Journal of Economics Ôºà2024/3/30Ôºâ DOI: 10.1093/qje/qjad054 Abstract Translation: When studying an outcome variable Y that can equal 0 (e.g., earnings), most researchers typically use a transformed average treatment effect (ATE) for estimation. This transformation can be represented as log (Y) when the outcome variable Y is large, and log (1 + Y) is usually used when Y equals 0. Our research finds that such logarithmic transformations of the average treatment effect should not be interpreted as percentage effects because the outcome itself is not a percentage, and the estimated average treatment effect depends on the units of the outcome variable. In fact, our study shows that if the actual units of Y are changed before performing a logarithmic transformation, treatment effects of any size can be obtained. This result arises because, for samples where the outcome changes from zero to non-zero during estimation, the percentage effect at the sample level is not well-defined, and the units of the outcome implicitly determine the weight given to the extensive margin in the logarithmic transformation of the average treatment effect. Further research reveals an ‚Äúimpossible triangle‚Äù: when the outcome variable can equal zero, it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy the estimation result as the sample‚Äôs average treatment effect, keep the units of Y unchanged (or independent of unit changes), and achieve point identification. We discuss several alternative methods that may be reasonable and feasible in settings with both intensive and extensive margins, including (1) expressing the average treatment effect in percentage terms (e.g., using Poisson regression), (2) explicitly calibrating samples on the intensive and extensive margins, and (3) separately estimating the actual treatment effects on the extensive and intensive margins (e.g., using Lee bounds). We illustrate these methods in three empirical applications.

Meaning of Coefficients After Logarithmic Transformation After taking the logarithm of a variable, it is generally believed that the coefficient reflects the percentage change. For example, lnGDP in a regression represents the percentage change in GDP. If it is reg lny lnx, the economic meaning of the coefficient is elasticity. See The Meaning of Taking Logarithms. For the following regression equation $$ \\ln y_n=\\alpha+\\beta x_n +\\varepsilon $$ the coefficient has the following economic meaning $$ \\begin{align} \\beta \u0026 = \\frac{\\ln Y_{n+1}-\\ln Y_{n}}{X_{n+1}-X_{n}}\\\\ \u0026=\\frac{\\ln \\frac{Y_{n+1}}{Y_{n}}}{X_{n+1}-X_{n}}= \\frac{\\ln (1+\\frac{Y_{n+1}-Y_{n}}{Y_{n}})}{\\Delta X}\\\\ \u0026= \\frac{\\ln (1+\\Delta Y \\% )}{\\Delta X} \\approx\\frac{\\Delta Y \\% }{\\Delta X} \\end{align} $$ Sometimes researchers perform logarithmic transformation because the data exhibits a long-tailed distribution, and logarithmic transformation makes the data more compact. Limitations of Logarithmic Transformation The core conclusion of the paper is that when the data contains zeros and the scaling units change (e.g., in labor economics, hourly wages, monthly wages, and weekly wages are often used, which involves unit conversion), the estimation of logarithmic transformation will change, making it unreliable. It is generally believed that the treatment effect obtained after logarithmic transformation is a percentage and is independent of the scaling parameter $\\alpha$. $$ \\small ATE=E[\\log(1+aY(1))-\\log(1+aY(0))]=E\\left[\\log\\left(\\frac{1+aY(1)}{1+aY(0)}\\right)\\right] $$ Further considering the data structure, changes will occur $$ \\begin{aligned} \\lim_{a\\to\\infty}\\log\\left(\\frac{1+aY(1)}{1+aY(0)}\\right)=\\begin{cases}\\log\\left(\\frac{Y(1)}{Y(0)}\\right)\u0026\\text{if }Y(1)\u003e0,Y(0)\u003e0\\\\ 0\u0026\\text{if }Y(1)=0,Y(0)=0\\\\ \\infty\u0026\\text{if }Y(1)\u003e0,Y(0)=0\\\\ -\\infty\u0026\\text{if }Y(1)=0,Y(0)\u003e0 \\end{cases} \\end{aligned} $$ The latter three cases in the above equation show that the estimated treatment effect may be affected. The paper‚Äôs discussion on the bias of logarithmic transformation is similar to the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE). ![Taking Employment Policy as the Research Object](/img/Is the Logarithmic Transformation with Zero Values Reliable-20240523094100269.webp) Taking employment policy as the object, the policy shock brings different responses to the treatment group. 0 represents the unemployed state, and 1 represents the employed state. Originally, the treatment group had unemployed people 0 and employed people 1, but after the policy shock, all became employed people 1. Originally in state 1 (employed), after the shock, still in state 1 (employed), but income still increased. At this time, the change in the explanatory variable is directly brought by the policy shock, which is the intensive margin. Originally in state 0, after the shock, became 1. The change in the explanatory variable is not only due to the policy shock but also due to the change in their own state, which is the extensive margin. Thus, the measurement of the treatment effect becomes the following situation: Therefore, the average treatment effect is also the sum of the mathematical expectations of the two marginal effects $$ ATT=E(ATT^{int})+E(ATT^{ext}) $$ If $lg(1+x)$ is used for transformation and the units are scaled, from thousands to units For the intensive margin, $$ \\begin{aligned} ATT_{1000}^{int}\u0026 =E{log(1000Y^{int}(1))-log(1000Y^{int}(0))} \\\\ \u0026=E{log(1000)+logY^{int}(1))-log(1000)-logY^{int}(0))} \\\\ \u0026=E{log(Y^{int}(1))-log(Y^{int}(0))}=ATT^{int} \\end{aligned} $$ For the extensive margin, This part is the part where the state changes from 0 to 1. After using $ln(y+1)$ for logarithmic transformation, the part that was originally 0 is still 0. $$ \\begin{aligned} ATT_{1000}^{ext} \u0026 =E{log(1000Y^{ext}(1))-log(1000Y^{ext}(0))} \\\\ \u0026=E{log(","date":"2024-05-12","objectID":"/en/posts/log0/:4:0","tags":["Literature Review"],"title":"Econometrics: Is the Log (y+1) Transformation Reliable?","uri":"/en/posts/log0/"},{"categories":["Economics Learning"],"content":"Conclusion and Solutions ","date":"2024-05-12","objectID":"/en/posts/log0/:5:0","tags":["Literature Review"],"title":"Econometrics: Is the Log (y+1) Transformation Reliable?","uri":"/en/posts/log0/"},{"categories":["Economics Learning"],"content":"Conclusion When facing samples with explanatory variables containing 0!

In elementary school, we began to encounter unknowns like $x$. In middle school, we started to learn about specific functions like $f(x) = ax + bx^2 + c$. In high school, we began to understand abstract functions like $f(x) = f(-x)$ and $f‚Äô(x) = f(x)$. In university, we started to learn about implicit functions like $y‚Äô = y + y‚Äô‚Äô$, which solve a class of functions. As our study of functions moves from concrete to abstract, we begin to develop the ability to infer the form of a function based on its properties. Nonlinear functionals in functional analysis are functions of functions. Given specific functional characteristics, we can narrow down the range of functional forms and then select the optimal function based on constraints. For example, a firm choosing the optimal production process, or an architect selecting the best curve for a building‚Ä¶ Previously, given a specific type of function, we sought extremum points; Now, given functional characteristics, we seek the best specific function. Generally, the characteristic constraints of a function can be expressed as $f(t, y(t), y‚Äô(t))$, which can be understood as $f(\\text{time}, \\text{state}, \\text{direction})$. As shown in the figure below, there are three functions from $a$ to $b$ that satisfy the functional characteristics. Which one is the optimal? This introduces the use of calculus to find the extremum of the functional path. Functions satisfying constraints\r$$ V(t) = \\int_0^T f(t, y, y‚Äô) dt $$ As the functional form $y$ changes, $V(t)$ also changes. This is the starting point of functional analysis. We aim to find the optimal path $y^*$ from a set of functional forms $y$ by seeking the extremum of $V(t)$ and other constraints.

Thus, we obtain the following functional: $$ V(t) = \\int_0^T 2\\pi y ds = 2\\pi \\int_0^T y (1 + y‚Äô^2)^{1/2} dt $$ Simplifying the expression: $$ V(t) = \\int_0^T y (1 + y‚Äô^2)^{1/2} dt $$ Using the Euler equation, we get: $$ y (1 + y‚Äô^2)^{1/2} - y y‚Äô^2 (1 + y‚Äô^2)^{-1/2} = c $$ Simplifying (by rationalizing the denominator and squaring to eliminate the square root in the denominator), we obtain: $$ y‚Äô \\left( \\equiv \\frac{dy}{dt} \\right) = \\frac{1}{c} \\sqrt{y^2 - c^2} $$ Which is: $$ \\frac{c dy}{\\sqrt{y^2 - c^2}} = dt $$ Integrating, we get: $$ \\int \\frac{c dy}{\\sqrt{y^2 - c^2}} = c \\ln \\left( \\frac{y + \\sqrt{y^2 - c^2}}{c} \\right) + c_1 = \\int dt = t + c_2 $$ Rearranging the above expression and combining the two arbitrary constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ into $k$, we obtain the general solution: $$ y^*(t) = \\frac{c}{2} \\left[ e^{(t + k)/c} + e^{-(t + k)/c} \\right] $$ And the catenary curve is of the form: $$ y = \\frac{1}{2} (e^t + e^{-t}) $$ Catenary curve, image from Wikipedia\rA uniformly dense string (e.g., a clothesline) hanging under uniform gravitational force will also form this curve.

Writing $F$ as the common profit function $\\pi$, we get: $$ \\pi - P‚Äô \\frac{\\partial \\pi}{\\partial P‚Äô} = c $$ Considering static monopoly, the monopoly firm makes only one pricing decision (more detailed static game theory also considers product differentiation, information asymmetry, game sequence, and firm entry/exit states). In this case, the profit function only depends on $P$ and not on $P‚Äô$ (since there is only one pricing decision, no price change occurs). Clearly, $P‚Äô \\frac{\\partial \\pi}{\\partial P‚Äô} = 0$, so $\\pi_s = c$. Now, consider dynamic game theory on top of static game theory. After the first pricing decision, monopoly firms begin to make multiple pricing decisions. The profit function is now: $$ \\pi - P‚Äô \\frac{\\partial \\pi}{\\partial P‚Äô} = \\pi_s $$ Here, the profit function $\\pi$ must depend on both $P$ and $P‚Äô$. Thus, consider the elasticity of $\\pi$ with respect to $P‚Äô$, denoted as: $$ \\frac{\\partial \\pi}{\\partial P‚Äô} \\frac{P‚Äô}{\\pi} = \\varepsilon_{\\pi P‚Äô} $$ Substituting into the dynamic monopoly game formula, we get: $$ \\varepsilon_{\\pi P‚Äô} = 1 - \\frac{\\pi_\\varepsilon}{\\pi} $$ In other words, in dynamic monopoly, firms should continuously adjust their profit functions based on this relationship.

For example, according to Marx, the division between the propertied and the propertyless is a form of division of labor, which also brings class nature! Based on the labor theory of value, private property is undesirable, and this division of labor ultimately stems from property ownership. Adam Smith uses the ‚Äúinvisible hand‚Äù to avoid the part about ‚Äúthe bloody primitive accumulation of capitalism.‚Äù If we want to refute Marx‚Äôs view, we need to argue that division of labor indeed brings wealth growth.

Classical Development Economics Yang Xiaokai advocates analyzing economic development from four aspects.

Geopolitical landscape Europe: Fragmented, low trade and defense costs, free cities developed before nation-states. China was the opposite.

Refuting Keynesianism Economic crises and World Wars I and II led to excessive concentration of political power. But does the occurrence of an economic crisis mean the failure of the free market? No, because highly specialized division of labor always comes with contradictions that are difficult to coordinate and couple. In Yang Xiaokai‚Äôs view, economic crises are like the risk of accidents on a highway. Choosing to involve the government is like giving up the highway after a single crash, which is an overreaction. Using division of labor to explain economic crises: the cobweb model and the general equilibrium model from the perspective of division of labor. This is also the core contradiction in the debate between Lin Yifu and Zhang Weiying on industrial policy‚Äîgovernment intervention can have adverse effects because it disrupts normal industrial division of labor, which is more severe than an economic crisis. However, please note that all this logic is based on the premise that division of labor determines economic growth. The disadvantage of backwardness is the same; imitation can only optimize short-term division of labor, which does not align with long-term natural market trends and will inevitably lead to problems. The Soviet Union‚Äôs planned economy made more people admire ‚Äúsocial experiments‚Äù‚Äîattempting government intervention. But the Soviet Union eventually collapsed, so Yang Xiaokai believes the Soviet model also proves Keynes wrong. In my personal view, Yang Xiaokai‚Äôs argument ignores the injustice of colonial movements and skips over the economic causes of World Wars I and II, which might have been caused by the excessive laissez-faire market leading to unequal resource distribution. Perhaps the market brings efficiency but neglects fairness, leading to revolutions. Incorporating freedom into development is a historic moment in development economics. Exploring what is just and fair is also a historic moment in development economics. Hayek‚Äôs prophecy succeeded, but the correct answer does not mean the process was correct.

What is Inframarginal Analysis? Marginal analysis considers the allocation of resources, addressing the question of how much to allocate. But inframarginal analysis is about making choices, dealing with either-or contradictions. In life, people often face many choices between ‚Äúyes‚Äù and ‚Äúno.‚Äù For example: When you graduate from high school and need to choose a major for university, if you choose economics among economics, chemistry, and physics, it means you won‚Äôt attend chemistry and physics classes during university, but you will attend microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, and other economics electives. This means that before we perform marginal analysis on the time allocation for major courses, we first consider which major to choose‚Äîthis preliminary decision-making process is the exploration of the national market‚Äôs division of labor. This additional process of choosing a major is inframarginal. From a mathematical perspective, we perform a two-step optimization analysis: Inframarginal analysis part: Find global multiple corner solutions, interior solutions, and compare total costs and benefits. For example, which has better market prospects‚Äîstudying economics, management, or physics? At this stage, we cannot perform marginal analysis; we can only compare total costs and total benefits. After confirming a major, we then use marginal analysis to determine the time allocation for our studies, which is the marginal analysis of grades and time. For example, the Lewis Turning Point and public choice theory have not been mathematized in mainstream economics because of conflicting interests. The government does not seek to maximize social welfare but rather a game of interests among various parties. The urban-rural dichotomy is also a problem of conflicting interests brought by division of labor. Most importantly‚Äîwhether it is equilibrium and Pareto optimality analysis or Marx‚Äôs economics, none can answer one question: Why can productivity improve through the improvement of division of labor when the production function and resource endowment remain unchanged??? So let‚Äôs return to classical operations research and control theory, and Yang Xiaokai also wrote a preliminary control theory. A very dated book. Yang Xiaokai‚Äôs books seem quite collectible, and second-hand ones are expensive. I chose to borrow from the library.

General Equilibrium and Network Analysis Yang Xiaokai believes that Marshall‚Äôs supply and demand analysis is limited to the relationship between two goods, making many things appear exogenous. The Difference Between Exogenous and Endogenous Generally, exogenous variables are used as fixed parameters, with unchanged values, usually referring to variables outside the model. For example, in the short term, technology and institutions remain unchanged, so they can be understood as exogenous parameters. Correspondingly, variables within the model are endogenous. In the long run, everything can change, so everything tends to become endogenous. Adam Smith did not elaborate on the ‚Äúinvisible hand,‚Äù and this process, like machine learning, is a black box. From the perspective of general equilibrium, due to the large number of commodity exchanges forming a trade circle, a huge trading network is formed, where many transactions influence each other, eventually reaching equilibrium, which is the embodiment of the concept of general. Therefore, Yang Xiaokai emphasizes the need for network analysis. Yang Xiaokai‚Äôs model endogenizes division of labor through network analysis, thereby demonstrating the spontaneous development of the market.

Many people criticize economics as a pseudo-science wrapped in mathematics, but here we mainly want to explain the reason for the formation of this paradigm. Economics strives to imitate physics, following the process of phenomenon-mathematical model-experimental verification. However, since social sciences do not have the powerful experimental verification of natural sciences, statistical verification is used as a substitute. Whether it is Yang Xiaokai‚Äôs neoclassical development economics or Lin Yifu‚Äôs new structural economics, both derive conclusions from international trade. Similarly, when a theory encounters phenomena it cannot explain‚Äîin the field of international trade, it is the Leontief Paradox‚Äîpatches or revisions are needed. Many people use human irrationality to refute economics, but in fact, there are many theoretical patches in this area. If one wants to establish a new framework, it must also be compatible with the phenomena described in the above flowchart. For example, later, Paul Krugman found that even without comparative advantage, increasing returns to scale can increase trade. (However, some people criticize Nobel laureate Krugman for being more of an economic writer.) Marc Melitz explains the emergence of international trade at the firm level, and many believe this theory will eventually win a Nobel Prize. Yang Xiaokai extended the consumer-producer trade model based on Ricardo‚Äôs trade theory. Each individual (unlike countries and firms) is both a consumer and a producer, allowing us to understand international trade from an individual perspective. Domestic trade is a necessity, and international trade is caused by exogenous comparative advantage, with transaction costs affecting individual choices in both domestic and international trade.

What are the causal frameworks? Today, with numerous causal frameworks emerging and various disciplines such as statistics (including pharmacology and psychology, each with its own statistical interpretation), economics, and computer science having their own schools of thought, the landscape has become intricate and diverse. It is intertwined and complex, and I am not entirely sure about the overall system. Personally, I have been exposed to Judea Pearl‚Äôs Structural Causal Model (SCM) the most. Regarding his work ‚ÄúThe Book of Why,‚Äù1 My personal understanding is that association-intervention-counterfactual represents the three levels of causality. The selection of control variables controls for backdoor paths, while setting instrumental variables controls for frontdoor paths. Correlation does not imply causation; correlation does not discuss directionality. Causality is unidirectional, so we need directed acyclic graphs to guide us. After identifying pathways, we then analyze to envision a counterfactual world.\rThe knowledge about ATE (Average Treatment Effect), ATT (Average Treatment Effect for the Treated), ITT (Intention-to-Treat), and LATE (Local Average Treatment Effect) appears sporadically in ‚ÄúMostly Harmless Econometrics‚Äù 1. The entire framework is based on Donald Rubin‚Äôs proposal of the Potential Outcome Framework (also known as Rubin Causal Model, abbreviated as RCM). It‚Äôs interesting that Judea Pearl (in ‚ÄúThe Book of Why‚Äù) proposes that counterfactuals under causal pathways are the same as Rubin‚Äôs concept of ‚Äúpotential outcomes.‚Äù However, Rubin responded that the two are completely different 2and does not endorse the analysis method of path diagrams. (Personally, I find it difficult to understand Rubin‚Äôs response, as in my view, the direction of arrows in SCM corresponds to the direction of addition and subtraction signs in RCM). As far as I know, causal analysis in statistics is currently divided into frequentist and Bayesian schools of thought. Research is conducted to understand causal inference through Markov chains. Personally, I am quite unfamiliar with this area of knowledge. My understanding of this topic mainly comes from educational videos by Fmajor on Bilibili. 2. More details about RCM ATE (Average Treatment Effect), ATT (Average Treatment Effect for the Treated), ITT (Intention-to-Treat), and LATE (Local Average Treatment Effect) are different statistical estimators.

However, this type of group comparison is just the starting point for causal discussions. It is necessary to further decompose these group differences to explore causal relationships. Average Treatment Effect (ATE): The difference between the means of two groups is directly used as the estimator. It can be considered as the difference between the population means or as the mean difference between groups (e.g., in the estimation of twin data): $$\\bar Y_1-\\bar Y_0=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{Y_{i}(1)-Y_{i}(0)}{N}$$ Treating $D_i$ as the treatment variable, where $D_i = 1$ represents the experimental group and $D_i = 0$ represents the control group, the linear equation is as follows: $$\\begin{align}Y_{i}\u0026=\\begin{cases} Y_{1i} \\quad if D_i = 1 \\newline Y_{0i} \\quad if D_i = 0 \\end{cases} \\newline \u0026=Y_{0i}+(Y_{1i}-Y_{0i})D_{i} \\end{align}$$ Subtracting the two equations, we obtain the following expression: $$\\begin{aligned} \u0026\\mathbf{E}[Y_{i}\\mid D_{i}=1]-\\mathbf{E}[Y_{i}\\mid D_{i}=0]\\newline\u0026 =\\color{red}{\\underbrace{\\mathbf{E}\\lfloor Y_{1i}\\mid D_{i}=1\\rfloor-\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]}_{\\text{ATT}} } \\newline \u0026+\\underbrace{\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]-\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=0]}_{SelectionBias} \\end{aligned}$$ Where $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]$ is intentionally introduced by us, representing another ‚Äúparallel universe‚Äù that we wish to explore but cannot directly observe‚Äîassuming that the subgroup represented by $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{\\color{blue}{1i}}\\mid D_{i}=1]$ did not receive the treatment in the parallel world. Their state is denoted as $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{\\color{blue}{0i}}\\mid D_{i}=1]$, which is the ‚Äúpotential outcome‚Äù that Rubin aims to find. $\\color{red}{\\mathbf{E}\\left[ Y_{1i}\\mid D_{i}=1 \\right] - \\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]}$ represents the Average Treatment Effect on Treated (ATT). There is no better controlled experiment than ‚Äúa binary choice splitting into two parallel universes‚Äù, but no one can truly obtain such data! Therefore, economists attempt to estimate ATT through ATE, hence the introduction of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Under the conditions of a randomized experiment, ATE = ATT. Next, let‚Äôs delve into the explanation: Subtracting the subgroup $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]$ from the subgroup that has never received treatment in the real world $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=0]$, if the result is non-zero, selection bias occurs. The reason may be sampling selection bias: for example, conducting a fitness-related survey only at gyms would definitely not achieve effective comparison; another example is the well-known survivorship bias in the military, where the returned planes are the ones that survived, making it unreliable to estimate the areas that need reinforcement based on their damages. It could also be self-selection bias: for example, an uneven gender ratio in admissions does not necessarily indicate discrimination, as this analysis overlooks the gender ratio in application tendencies. Some genders may be more inclined to apply for more challenging positions, leading to higher rejection rates; police enforcement focusing more on a certain race does not necessarily imply discrimination, as it may simply reflect higher crime rates within that race. Omitted variables, model errors, measurement errors, and insufficient sample size can all contribute to bias. If we use the method of randomized trials, the samples are randomly distributed. We hope that this randomized trial can average out some unobserved influencing variables, thereby making $D_i$ and $Y_{0i}$ independent, which means $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]=\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=0]=\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}]$. At this point, the estimation of ATE has been effectively simplified: $$\\begin{aligned} \u0026\\mathbf{E}[Y_{1i}\\mid D_{i}=1]-\\mathbf{E}[Y_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1]\\newline\u0026=ATT =\\mathbf{E}[\\mathbf{Y}_{1i}-\\mathbf{Y}_{0i}\\mid D_{i}=1] \\newline \u0026=ATE=\\mathbf{E}[Y_{1i}-Y_{0i}] \\end{aligned}$$ Further estimating through regression equations: $$\\begin{align}Y_{i}\u0026=\\begin{cases} Y_{1i} \\quad if D_i = 1 \\newline Y_{0i} \\quad if D_i = 0 \\end{cases} \\newline \u0026=Y_{0i}+(Y_{1i}-Y_{0i})D_{i} \\newline \u0026 =\\alpha+\\rho D_i+\\eta_i \\end{align}$$ $$\\begin{aligned}\u0026\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[Y_i\\mid D_i=1]=\\alpha+\\rho+\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[\\eta_i\\mid D_i=1]\\newline \u0026\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[Y_i\\mid D_i=0]=\\alpha+\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[\\eta_i\\mid D_i=0]\\end{aligned}$$ We can obtain the difference between the two. $$\\begin{aligned}\u0026\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[Y_i\\mid D_i=1]-\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[Y_i\\mid D_i=0]\\newline \u0026=\\underbrace{\\rho}_\\text{Treatment effect}+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[\\eta_i\\mid D_i=1]-\\operatorname{\\mathbf{E}}[\\eta_i\\mid D_i=0]}_\\text{secletion bias}\\end{aligned}$$ When there is selection bias $\\eta_i \\neq 0$, it means that the residual is correlated with $D_i$. We emphasize randomized trials because we hope that random intervention experiments can make the two unrelated, eliminating this selection bias. So when randomized trials are satisfied, $\\eta_i=0$, $ATE \\xrightarrow{RCT} ATT$. This also tells us why we should pay attention to residual analysis.

Although randomized intervention trials are useful, the variables we want to study are not always randomly distributed. For example, industrial land tends to aggregate around certain grades of land. In this case, buyers are not randomly distributed. In such scenarios, we consider other randomly distributed variables that may influence their decisions. It‚Äôs more illustrative to first understand this using the path diagram of SCM: Angrist (2011) is a paper that examines the impact of participating in the Vietnam War on income. In this study, the variable of military enlistment was found to be problematic, so the author used enlistment eligibility as an instrumental variable. (Nostalgic for the era of short 6-page econometric papers) 2SLS\rClearly, there exists a process where an individual is first informed of their enlistment eligibility and then decides whether to enter the military. The ITT equation is as follows: It can be observed that the ITT estimate is quite similar to $\\mathbf{E}[Y_{i}\\mid D_{i}=1]-\\mathbf{E}[Y_{i}\\mid D_{i}=0]$, meaning that when $D_i$ and $Z_i$ are one-to-one corresponding, i.e., when $z=d$, ITT = ATE. $\\pi_N$: Regardless of whether I am eligible or not, I will never join the military. $\\pi_D$: Contrarian attitude, I will join the military if I am eligible, and I will refuse if I am not eligible. $\\pi_A$: Regardless of whether I am eligible or not, I will always join the military. $\\pi_C$: Compliance, I will join if eligible, and I will not join if not eligible. The source of the diagram is the Oxford courseware (Week 4 lecture): https://andy.egge.rs/teaching/causal_inference/\rDue to the non-random distribution of $Di$, as we are based on a sample of military personnel for statistics, we have only the following equation: $$\\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{E}[D_i=1|Z_i=0]=\\pi_A+\\pi_D\\newline \\mathbf{E}[D_i=1|Z_i=1]=\\pi_A+\\pi_C \\end{aligned}$$ In this case, we cannot estimate $\\pi_i$ separately for $\\pi_i$ , $i‚àà{A,C,D,N}$. However, due to the random distribution, the results will be proportional, allowing us to derive a linear equation: The solution is to make an assumption ‚Äî quite reminiscent of an economics joke. Here‚Äôs the original joke: A physicist, a chemist, and an economist are stranded on a deserted island, starving. Suddenly, a can of food washes ashore. The physicist says, ‚ÄúWe can use rocks to apply momentum to the can, causing its surface to fatigue and rupture.‚Äù The chemist says, ‚ÄúWe can make a fire, then heat the can, causing it to expand until it bursts.‚Äù The economist then says, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs assume we have a can opener‚Ä¶‚Äù After introducing the assumption, we directly obtain the LATE: $$\\mathrm{LATE}=\\mathrm{CATE}_{\\mathcal{C}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{ITT}}{\\pi_{\\mathcal{C}}}$$ $$\\small \\hat{\\mathbf{CATE}_C}=\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\Big[Y_i|Z_i=1\\Big]-\\mathbf{E}\\Big[Y_i|Z_i=0\\Big]}{\\mathbf{E}\\Big[D_i|Z_i=1\\Big]-\\mathbf{E}\\Big[D_i|Z_i=0\\Big]}=\\frac{\\mathrm{effect~of~}Z_i\\text{ on }Y_i}{\\mathrm{effect~of~}Z_i\\text{ on }D_i}=\\frac{\\operatorname{ITT}_Y}{\\operatorname{ITT}_D}$$ The LATE section heavily relies on the Oxford course material. For a more algebraic explanation, refer to the Harvard course material and ‚ÄúMostly Harmless Econometrics.‚Äù Social science attributes in mathematical economics The social science attributes in mathematical economics are evident in the need to articulate assumptions that capture social phenomena. For instance, when studying unique policies, it‚Äôs essential to argue that the policy affects everyone, reflecting the assumption of monotonicity. Similarly, when using instrumental variables, it‚Äôs crucial to discuss the social relationship between the instrument and the explanatory variable. These assumptions serve as concise descriptions of social phenomena, highlighting the distinct social science nature of economic analysis.

Here, it is assumed that the returns to education are linear and the returns to work experience are nonlinear for the logarithmized wages. Heckman et al. (2006) empirically tested this assumption in their related research 2. Even if we don‚Äôt discuss the specific form of the equation, such a decomposition of variables is certainly insufficient. As the famous bread hunter DIO once said‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúJOJO, in the brief span of a human life, I have discovered‚Ä¶ The more one plays with schemes, the more limited one finds the capabilities of humanity to be‚Ä¶‚Äù Indeed! Human lifespan and physical stages are points we cannot ignore! Once we delve into labor economics, we cannot avoid discussing human age and condition. Bread Hunter‚Äî‚ÄîDIO\rFirstly, let‚Äôs consider the lifecycle. Even if individuals have the same education level and work experience, or even higher, the rate of return on education varies with age. Here, we estimate parameters that are age and time-related. Moreover, the historical context in which each individual exists also influences wage earnings. For instance, movements like ‚Äúgoing to the countryside‚Äù and ‚Äúreform and opening up‚Äù deeply affected specific cohorts. Here, we estimate parameters (usually categorized by birth year) that are related to individual cohorts and time. Additionally, time effects (including economic cycles and linear growth, such as wage inflation) are also related to time! All these parameters are time-dependent! Decomposing them in the econometric equation becomes a significant challenge. Hence, we have the following extended and flexible Mincer equation. $$ln(w_{ict})=\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict}$$ $i$ represents an independent number. $c$ represents the group number, for example, one group was born during the reform and opening up, one group was born when people went to the mountains and countryside, and one cohort group 3. In the life cycle, work experience is generally divided into groups. The descriptive statistics in the figure below are preliminary descriptive statistics of the life cycle carried out by comparing groups after five years of grouping. $t$ represents the time variable. $\\theta(s_{ict})$ represents the education income function, $f(x_{ict})$ represents the work experience income function, $\\gamma_t$ represents the queue effect of group $c$, $\\chi_t$ represents the group queue Effect, $\\varepsilon_{ict}$ is the paper. Individual-level panel data is often challenging to obtain directly. Therefore, Deaton proposed: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need individual tracking panels anymore! Your room has no space left for you to obtain positions! We‚Äôll synthesize a ‚Äòpseudo-panel‚Äô from repeated cross-sections of census data! Epidemiology, drug trials, social psychology, and other statistical fields all make use of such pseudo-panels. For example, in the figure below: These income comparison data are not from individual tracking panel data but rather from a pseudo-panel constructed from cross-sectional data of different ages at the same time.‚Äù Life cycle wage growth across countries(2018Ôºâ\rThis type of panel data requires consideration of age, time period, and cohort as independent variables, also known as the Age-Period-Cohort Model (APC). In labor economics, the estimation of APC panel data has always been a hot topic (endorsed by the great Deaton, after all, it is a framework he established in economic analysis). For the estimation equation: $$ln(w_{ict})=\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict}$$ When we directly regress APC data, we encounter the problem of collinearity‚Äîage + birth year ","date":"2024-01-19","objectID":"/en/posts/hlt/:1:0","tags":["Literature Review","Stata"],"title":"HLT: Lifecycle and Wage Decomposition","uri":"/en/posts/hlt/"},{"categories":["Economic Study"],"content":"Deaton‚Äôs approachÔºàmathematical DecompositionÔºâ Angus Deaton, who won the Nobel Prize in 2015 for his research on poverty, has made significant contributions to labor economics, with much discussion focused on his findings that aid may worsen conditions 4. The following method is mainly based on his work ‚ÄúThe Analysis of Household Surveys: A Microeconometric Approach to Development Policy‚Äù (1997) (starting from page 123), to be honest, it feels a bit, well, unfriendly. For the formula: $$ln(w_{ict})=\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict}$$ Like this: $$w_{ict}=\\exp (\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict})$$ The aggregate total wage can be decomposed into sums grouped first by $c$, and within each group, summed over individuals $i$: $$\\begin{aligned} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{ct}}w_{ict}=\u0026 \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{ct}}\\exp(\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict}) \\newline \u0026=\\exp(\\alpha+\\gamma_t+\\chi_c)\\underbrace{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{ct}}\\exp(\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\varepsilon_{ict})}_{F_{ct}} \\newline \u0026=\\exp(\\alpha+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c})F_{ct} \\end{aligned}$$ $F_{ct}$ at this point represents the total wage contribution of both the education experience function $\\theta(s_{ict})$ and the work experience function $f(x_{ict})$. Define $\\bar{F}_t = \\sum*{c\\in C_t} F_{ct}$, then proceed to separate this part out, transforming it as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} W_{t}=\u0026 \\sum_{c\\in C_{t}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{ct}}w_{ict} \\newline \u0026=\\sum_{c\\in C_{t}}\\exp(\\alpha+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c})F_{ct} \\newline \u0026=\\exp(\\alpha)\\exp(\\gamma_{t})\\sum_{c\\in C_{t}}\\exp(\\chi_{c})F_{ct} \\newline \u0026=\\exp(\\alpha)\\exp(\\gamma_{t})\\bar{F}_{t}\\sum_{c\\in C_{t}}\\exp(\\chi_{c})\\frac{F_{ct}}{\\bar{F}_{t}} \\end{aligned}$$ At this point, wages can be decomposed into three parts: time effect $\\Gamma_{t}$, the effect of work experience and education $\\bar F_{t}$, and cohort effect $\\bar X_{t}$. $$W_{t}=\\underbrace{\\exp(\\gamma_{t})}_{\\Gamma_{t}}\\bar F_{t}\\underbrace{\\sum_{c\\in C_{t}}\\exp(\\chi_{c})\\frac{F_{ct}}{\\overline{F_{t}}}}_{\\tilde{X_{t}}}$$ The effects of work experience and education can be quantified through the years of education and work, but identifying the time effect and cohort effect is challenging. Therefore, the purpose of this approach is to isolate and study the time and cohort effects separately. Hence, we define: $$\\Omega_{t}=\\frac{W_t}{\\bar F_{t}}=\\Gamma_{t}\\bar{X}_{t}$$ In studying cohort and time effects, we typically approach it from two perspectives. Time trend: Our technology always advances over time, representing a time trend that progresses on average. Cyclical variations: For example, seasonal vegetables have cyclical supply and demand patterns, or the baby boom generation‚Äîwhen the baby boomers reach middle age, there may be a peak in the labor force. time effects\rAt this point logarithmize again‚Äî‚Äî $\\omega_t=\\log\\Omega_t,\\bar{\\chi}_t=\\log\\bar{X}_tÔºå\\bar{\\gamma}_t=\\log\\bar{\\Gamma}_t$ ‚Äã At the same time, it should be emphasized that what is defined is that $\\bar{\\chi}_t$ and $\\bar{\\gamma}_t$ are the deviations of the sample mean at this time. Just like we assume that the sum of residuals after regression is 0, this assumption also requires that the sum of sample mean residuals is 0: $$\\frac1T\\sum_{t=0}^T\\gamma_t=\\frac1T\\sum_{t=0}^T\\bar{\\chi}_t=0$$ At this time, the formula is decomposed into: $\\omega_t=\\bar{\\omega}+\\bar \\gamma_t+\\bar{\\chi}_t$ The original paper only stated that $\\bar{\\omega}$ is ‚Äúan appropriately chosen constant‚Äù. Personally, I think it is the sample mean, so in contrast, $\\bar{\\chi}_t$ and ${\\bar \\gamma}_t$ are the deviations from the sample mean. At this time, both the time effect and the queue effect can be decomposed into time trend$g$ and periodic change $u$, which can be expressed by $gt+u$, and the following decomposition is obtained: $$\\gamma_{t}=g_{\\gamma}t+u_{\\gamma,t},\\quad\\bar{\\chi}_{t}=g_{\\bar \\chi}t+u_{\\bar \\chi,t}$$ We make $g_{\\omega}=g_{\\bar \\gamma}+g_{\\ba","date":"2024-01-19","objectID":"/en/posts/hlt/:2:0","tags":["Literature Review","Stata"],"title":"HLT: Lifecycle and Wage Decomposition","uri":"/en/posts/hlt/"},{"categories":["Economic Study"],"content":"Quantitative decomposition That is to say, the following formula is estimated: $$\\log(w_{ict})=\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+\\sum_{x\\in\\mathbf{X}}\\phi_{x}D_{ict}^{x}+\\gamma_ {t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict}$$ $\\theta(s_{ict})$ represents the income function of educational age, which is generally expressed linearly. $D_{ict}^{x}$ is a dummy variable for each age group in the life cycle. tip Let‚Äôs review the knowledge points about dummy variables (dummy) in measurement: Generally, n categories are used to generate n-1 dummy variables to avoid collinearity. That is to say, if there is a period of 5 years, 30 years will be divided into 6 periods, so the period of 0-4 years is generally omitted and 5 dummy variables are generated. The generated coefficients are all conclusions drawn from comparing with the missing parts. In other words, each coefficient is compared to the growth level in the 0-4 years segment. $\\gamma_{t}$: time effect. $\\chi_{c}$ individual effects.

If you want to see the super-detailed derivation, it is recommended to check out ‚ÄúDisentangling age, cohort and time effects in the additive model‚Äù (McKenzie et al., 2006) 6. For the estimated formula: $$ ln(w_{ict})=\\alpha+\\theta(s_{ict})+f(x_{ict})+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ict} $$ Direct regression will have the problem of collinearity - age + year of birth = current year. We cannot directly estimate the form of $\\gamma_t$ and $\\chi_t$ (such as concavity and convexity), but we can use the difference method to study the properties of high-order differences after group subtraction, and then estimate low-order differences. In the life cycle model here, the years of education are linear estimates and easy to decompose, so we ignore 7 for now. The individual number is $i$, and the queue is grouped $c$ according to the life cycle. $k$ is the work experience, which is equal to $t-c$. The corresponding equations for each group of queues are as follows: $$ y_{ct}=\\alpha+\\beta _kx_{ct}+\\gamma_{t}+\\chi_{c}+\\varepsilon_{ct} $$ **Emphasis! In other words, the estimate of $\\color{red}{k}$ of $\\beta_{\\color{red}{k}}$ is closely related to $\\color{blue}{k=t-c}$! ! ! ! We take advantage of this to perform high-order difference estimation. ** We are in the same group (for example, we select the middle-aged group $c_1$), and use the data of $y_{c_1,t_2}$ minus $y_{c_1,t_1}$ to carry out the time analysis within the group. The first difference** of: During the life cycle, the time difference of each group of queues is evenly distributed, basically every five years, that is $$ (x_{ci,t+1}-x_{ci,t})=(x_{cj,t+1}-x_{cj,t})=\\Delta x_t $$ So the formula can be transformed as follows: $$ \\begin{align} \u0026y_{c_1,t_2}-y_{c_1,t_1}\\newline \u0026=(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{1}}})(x_{c_1,t_2}- x_{c_1,t_1})+(\\gamma_{t_2}-\\gamma_{t_1})+(\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_2}-\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_1})\\newline \u0026=(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{1}}})\\Delta x_t+(\\gamma_{t_2}-\\gamma_{t_1})+(\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_2}-\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_1})\\newline \\end{align} $$ The corresponding time relationship $k=t-c$, we then perform the first-order difference in time on another same group. We select a group $c_{0}$ that is younger than group $c_{1}$ (regarded as a youth group), and get $k_2=t_1-c_0,k_3=t_2-c_0$. At this point the first difference is obtained: $$ \\begin{align} \u0026y_{c_0,t_2}-y_{c_0,t_1}\\newline \u0026=(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{3}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}})\\Delta x_t+(\\gamma_{t_1+1}-\\gamma_{t_1})+(\\varepsilon_{c_0,t_2}-\\varepsilon_{c_0,t_1})\\newline \\end{align} $$ At this time, we subtract the first-order differences of $c_1$ and $c_0$ the two sets of time: $$ \\begin{align} \u0026[y_{c_1,t_2}-y_{c_1,t_1}]-[y_{c_0,t_2}-y_{c_0,t_1}]\\newline \u0026=(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{1}}})\\Delta x_t+(\\gamma_{t_1+1}-\\gamma_{t_1})+(\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_2}-\\varepsilon_{c_1,t_1})\\newline \u0026-(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{3}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}})\\Delta x_t-(\\gamma_{t_1+1}-\\gamma_{t_1})-(\\varepsilon_{c_0,t_2}-\\varepsilon_{c_0,t_1})\\newline \u0026=[(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{1}}})-(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{3}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{2}}})]\\Delta x_t-\\Delta_{c}\\Delta_{t}\\varepsilon_{c_{0},t_{2}} \\end{align} $$ We can find that this high-order difference does not contain time effect $\\gamma_t$ and queue effect $\\chi_c$ at this time. $[(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{j}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{j-1}}})-(\\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{ j+2}}}- \\beta_{\\color{red}{k_{j}}})]$ also has geom","date":"2024-01-19","objectID":"/en/posts/hlt/:3:1","tags":["Literature Review","Stata"],"title":"HLT: Lifecycle and Wage Decomposition","uri":"/en/posts/hlt/"},{"categories":["Economic Study"],"content":"HLT Full name heckman-lochner-taber.

The original text can be found in ‚ÄúLife cycle wage growth across countries‚Äù (Lagakos et al., 2018) The previous equation estimate decomposes the wage contribution into: work experience, cohort, age, and education. This is what leads to collinearity, but this decomposition is not permanent. If we look at people‚Äôs wage growth from a life cycle perspective, we can put forward a hypothesis: **When a person is about to retire, he will give up any human capital investment. At this time, the source of his wage growth is only the time effect. **At this time, in the two cohorts, within the same $t$ year period, the wage growth rate of the elderly group is 1%; the growth rate of the youth group is 5%, which means that 1% is contributed by the time effect, and 4% is Queue effect + work experience. Then we can study whether the time effect of each group tends to be consistent in old age by continuously adjusting the income effect.

Inappropriate estimation methods can result in conclusions that are completely opposite to reality. To better understand data structure, economics has developed fixed effects, moderating effects, heterogeneity analysis, and robustness analysis. These may seem like distinct parts of empirical paradigms, but personally, I believe they all aim to classify data structures to ensure our conclusions are truly valid. Therefore, this article seeks to reorganize the operational significance of empirical papers from the perspective of data structure and variable classification, and to distinguish between different regression commands in STATA.

However, if we perform separate regressions for men and women, the conclusion is the opposite‚Äîhigher income leads to higher coffee consumption. Clearly, the latter aligns more with reality. This is $\\boxed{Simpson‚Äôs Paradox}$: local correlations and overall correlations can present completely different results. Simpson‚Äôs Paradox is ubiquitous in life, such as measuring the efficacy of drugs across different age groups, gender discrimination in college admissions, or racial bias in police enforcement. We should not only care about absolute values, such as the gender ratio of a certain outcome; But also observe relative values, such as whether police focus more on people of color because they have higher crime rates; „ÄäAn alternative test of racial prejudice in motor vehicle searches: Theory and evidence„ÄãÔºà2006Ôºâ1 is based on ‚Äúcrime rates by race and police enforcement focus‚Äù to study racial bias in police enforcement in Florida. Since Floyd‚Äôs ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe‚Äù went viral, many books have used this event to introduce counterfactual inference2 (e.g., Mostly Harmless Econometrics by Joshua D. Angrist). We should also pay attention to internal stratification, such as by race, region, gender‚Ä¶ as in the coffee consumption example above. One reason for Simpson‚Äôs Paradox is omitted variables and confounders3‚Äîin the case of coffee consumption and income, gender is an important factor we omitted, but by grouping and fitting, we controlled for it.

Residuals: Economic, Mathematical, and Statistical Meanings The ordinary regression equation OLS is: $$ Y=\\alpha X +u $$ This directly fits the overall data. Knowing Simpson‚Äôs Paradox, we understand that such regression is an overall fit and may yield completely different results from local fits. The residual $ \\color{red}{u} $ omits too much information we haven‚Äôt considered, such as gender classification. Therefore, we need to group the data and decompose the gender variable M from the residual $\\color{red}{u}$. $$ Y=\\alpha X +\\beta M+u $$ Here, we introduce $\\boxed{control variables}$. Note! This is my personal perspective on control variables from a grouping viewpoint, emphasizing their role in selection bias. This grouping requires careful consideration of the practical economic significance of control variables in our study. For example, numerous studies show that coffee consumption habits indeed differ by gender. The selection of control variables also serves to reduce confounding factors; additionally, we must consider optimal fitting, unbiased estimation, and other statistical mathematical meanings. With panel data, our equation becomes two-dimensional, with object/space coding i and time coding t. The ordinary regression equation OLS becomes: $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}=\\alpha X_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\beta M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+u_{_{\\color{red}{it}}} $$ To further decompose the economic interpretation of residuals across time and space/object dimensions, we continue to decompose: $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}=\\alpha X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\beta M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\lambda_{\\color{red}{i}}+\\gamma_{\\color{red}{t}}+u^{\\prime } $$ Thus, the equation becomes: $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}=\\alpha X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\beta M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\lambda_{\\color{red}{i}}+\\gamma_{\\color{red}{t}}+u^{\\prime } $$ First, let‚Äôs analyze their economic meaning‚Äîvariables: $\\boxed{\\gamma_{\\color{red}{t}}}:$ This part of the residual is the decomposition of the time dimension, indicating that this variation is only related to time, representing time effects. For example, seasonal vegetable yields are clearly related to seasons, and technology naturally progresses steadily over the long term. These effects are shared by all individuals, meaning all samples change synchronously over time. $\\boxed{\\lambda_{\\color{red}{i}}}:$ This part of the residual is the decomposition of the space/object dimension, indicating that this variation is only related to the individual, representing individual effects. For example, Apple took a long time to adopt USB-C, which is part of their corporate culture. Only Apple had this idea, and for a long time, they were the only company in their industry to insist on this. $\\boxed{u_{\\color{red}{it}}^{\\prime }}:$ The deviation between the actual value and the estimated value, outside our model‚Äôs explanation, is the residual. Causes include measurement errors, omitted variables, and models not aligning with reality‚Ä¶ Next, let‚Äôs analyze their mathematical meaning‚Äîintercepts: $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}=\\alpha X_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\beta D_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+(\\lambda_{\\color{red}{i}}+\\gamma_{\\color{red}{t}}+u^{\\prime }) $$ Clearly, $(\\lambda_{\\color{red}{i}}+\\gamma_{\\color{red}{t}}+u^{\\prime })$ as a constant is the intercept in the linear equation structure! Finally, let‚Äôs analyze their statistical meaning‚Äîresiduals: Whether there are different intercepts is closely related to the distribution of residuals, heteroscedasticity, and correlation. Fixed effects, random effects, and pooled regressions differ in how they decompose residuals, determining whether our model can explain individual and time effects. $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}=\\alpha X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\beta M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+(\\lambda_{\\color{red}{i}}+\\gamma_{\\color{red}{t}}+u^{\\prime }) \\newline \\xrightarrow{Decomposition} Explainable part + \\color{blue}{Unexplainable part} (error) $$ First, here‚Äôs a summary chart, followed by an explanation.

This can be seen as all data points sharing a single intercept. Here, we assume no individual effects: $\\lambda_{\\color{red}{i}}=0$. We also assume that the remaining residuals are uncorrelated with explanatory and control variables: $CovÔºàu|M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}},X_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}Ôºâ =0$, and the residuals follow a normal distribution. $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}=\\alpha X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\beta M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+u $$ Pooled OLS uses the least squares method to perform an overall regression on all points, with all data points sharing a single intercept u4.

Fixed Effects Divided into individual fixed effects and time fixed effects (double fixed). Individual Fixed Effects: $\\boxed{LSDV} :$ Pooled OLS treats all $\\lambda_{it}$ equally. Imagine observing the same person multiple times‚Äîpooled OLS treats each repeated observation as equally valuable. Fixed effects disagree, believing that individuals have certain traits, and repeated observations provide limited value. Therefore, we need to generate dummy individual variables (n-1) to identify each individual and estimate each individual‚Äôs effect separately, known as the ‚ÄúLeast Square Dummy Variable Model‚Äù (LSDV). This generates many control variables, so $R^2$ is high. $$ \\begin{align} Y_{\\color{red}{it}}\u0026=\\alpha X_{\\color{red}{it}}+\\beta M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\alpha_{1}D_{1}+\\alpha_{2}D_{2}+\\cdots+\\alpha_{N}D_{N}+u_{\\color{red}{it}}\\newline \\end{align} $$ Individual effects‚Äîcausal relationship diagram.

After setting xtset id year, id could be a spatial, industry, or individual identifier, giving us n groups. Each group has internal variance, which is within-group variance; there is also variance between groups, which is between-group variance. Variance analysis helps confirm whether our grouping is appropriate. Here, within-group estimation is used, which is more effective than between-group estimation. The argument is from Wooldridge‚Äôs econometrics textbook exercises and won‚Äôt be expanded here. $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}-\\bar Y_{\\color{red}{i}}=\\alpha (X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}-\\bar X _{\\color{red}{i}})+\\beta (M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}-\\bar M _{\\color{red}{i}})+(u_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}-\\bar u _{\\color{red}{i}}) $$ This equation can also be understood as the lagged $\\boxed{first-difference method}$. $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}-\\bar Y_{\\color{red}{i}}=Y_{\\color{red}{i,t}}-Y_{\\color{red}{i,t-1}} =\\alpha (X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}-X _{\\color{red}{i,t-1}})+\\beta (M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}- M _{\\color{red}{i,t-1}})+(u_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}- u _{\\color{red}{i,t-1}}) $$ In summary, there are currently three estimation equations for individual fixed effects: dummy variable least squares, within-group estimation, and first-difference. Their estimates are largely consistent, with differences mainly in data assumptions. First-difference eliminates individual effects, so it cannot estimate effects that do not change over time. Dummy least squares (LSDV) requires that the constructed dummy variables be strictly exogenous, and too many dummy variables may exceed STATA‚Äôs operational limits. $$ \\begin{cases} Y_{\\color{red}{it}}=\\alpha X_{\\color{red}{it}}+\\beta M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\sum_{1}^{N}{\\alpha_{j}D_{j}}+u_{\\color{red}{it}}\\newline Y_{\\color{red}{it}}-\\bar Y_{\\color{red}{i}}=\\alpha (X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}-\\bar X _{\\color{red}{i}})+\\beta (M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}-\\bar M _{\\color{red}{i}})+(u_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}-\\bar u _{\\color{red}{i}})\\newline Y_{\\color{red}{i,t}}-Y_{\\color{red}{i,t-1}} =\\alpha (X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}-X _{\\color{red}{i,t-1}})+\\beta (M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}- M _{\\color{red}{i,t-1}})+(u_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}- u _{\\color{red}{i,t-1}}) \\end{cases} $$ The goal is to correctly estimate the coefficient $\\alpha$ of the explained variable when individual effects are correlated with control variables, and the parameters $ \\alpha $ in the above four estimation equations are the same: $$ Y_{\\color{red}{it}}=\\alpha X _{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\beta M_{_{\\color{red}{it}}}+\\lambda_{\\color{red}{i}}+\\color{blue}{(\\gamma_{\\color{red}{t}}+u^{\\prime })}\\ $$ ","date":"2023-12-26","objectID":"/en/posts/ji_sata/:3:2","tags":["Causal Effects","Stata"],"title":"Grouping and Measurement of Econometric Data (STATA Version)","uri":"/en/posts/ji_sata/"},{"categories":["Software Tools","Economic Studies"],"content":"*Supplement: Frisch-Waugh-Lovell Theorem The lemma proving that dummy variable least squares and within-group estimation have the same coefficient $\\alpha$ is the ‚ÄúFrisch-Waugh-Lovell Theorem.‚Äù Here‚Äôs a minimal example: The real equation is: $$ Y=\\beta_1 X_1+ \\beta_2 X_2 +u_1 $$ We want to estimate $\\beta_1$, but we omitted variable $X_1$ and only regressed $X_2$, resulting in: $$ Y=\\alpha X_2+u_2 $$ Now, we regress $X_2$ and $X_1$ to get: $$ X_1=\\gamma X_2+u_3 $$ Finally, we regress the residuals: $$ u_2=\\dot \\beta u_3+u $$ Based on the residuals from the two regressions, we get: $$ \\begin{cases} u_2=Y-\\alpha X_2\\newline u_3 = X_1 - \\gamma X_2 \\end{cases} $$ Expanding and transforming, we directly obtain: $$ Y=\\dot \\beta X_1 + (\\alpha-\\gamma)X_2+u $$ We find that $\\dot \\beta=\\beta_1$, and through this indirect estimation, we estimate the desired coefficient $\\beta_1$.

(2) (3) (4) Cluster many regression equations with the same coefficients but different intercepts, and each point calculates variance with its corresponding regression equation, then sums them up. Why are $R^2$ different: (1) (3) (4) All use LSDV, so many dummy variables are generated. (2) Uses between-group estimation, so no dummy variables are generated.

The Gray Area of Mechanism Testing in Empirical Studies Simpson‚Äôs Paradox teaches us that grouped regression and overall regression can yield completely different results, partly due to omitted variables. Therefore, we need to add control variables. When using ‚Äúpanel data,‚Äù the data includes ‚Äútime‚Äù and ‚Äúspace‚Äù dimensions, which can still affect our research. Thus, we need to separate ‚Äúindividual effects‚Äù and ‚Äútime effects.‚Äù Answering Simpson‚Äôs Paradox‚Äîhere, we address causality, requiring avoidance of endogeneity. In mechanism testing, some use grouped regression or interaction terms to extend conclusions, assuming‚Äîthe new variable in mechanism testing is not an omitted control variable. There‚Äôs a big problem here‚Äîhow do you ensure there‚Äôs no endogeneity in mechanism testing? For example, in the figure below, the leftmost path is a collision path in causality, while the right side shows moderating and mediating effects in mechanism testing. Clearly, collision effects with confounders can still satisfy moderating and mediating effects. This introduces a new endogeneity issue!!!! Therefore, Zhu Jiaxiang and Zhang Wenrui (2021)[^8] state that moderating effects do not satisfy statistical causality testing. On this basis, Jiang Ting (2022)[^9] even calls for abandoning the three-step mediation method, as it‚Äôs meaningless‚Äîit neither proves nor disproves endogeneity. Thus, our mechanism testing is left with only two options: 1. Further prove no endogeneity. This requires another controlled experiment (feels like another mini economic empirical comparison); or discuss the correlation between residuals and the explained variable after grouped regression. Use correlation + theoretical explanation to approach causality. „ÄäCausal Inference in Empirical Research: Mediation and Moderation Effects„ÄãJiang Ting (2022)\r2. No need to prove, my variable is naturally exogenous. The variable has no endogeneity in practical terms, meaning more theoretical and economic explanations are needed. The most common ‚Äúfiller‚Äù in domestic research is the four major regions and the Hu Line, as these classifications are naturally exogenous variables in practical terms. It seems that mechanism testing is essentially an incomplete mini-empirical study, extending conclusions through incomplete empirical steps. Personally, I feel that no econometrics textbook emphasizes so-called ‚Äúmechanism analysis,‚Äù but it has become a specific requirement domestically. It seems that quantitative economics ultimately relies on a mix of practical theory and quantitative analysis.

Mediation Effects: Differences from Psychological Statistics The views on mediation effects mainly reference The Book of Why by Judea Pearl. When we ask why, there are two types of logical chains: one is principle, and the other is process. $$ Eating oranges\\rightarrow Vitamin C\\rightarrow Resisting scurvy\\newline Elderly\\rightarrow Falling\\rightarrow Hospitalization\\ $$ Taking the above two path diagrams as examples, the first one‚Äîeating vitamin C to resist scurvy‚Äîsounds more like a principle-based answer, while the elderly falling seems more like a process. I‚Äôve seen many forums and social scienceËá™Â™í‰Ωì videos claiming that ‚Äúeconomics stole mediation effects from psychology‚Äù‚Äîthis is not the case. Psychology can widely apply mediation effects because its path diagrams are: $external stimuli\\rightarrow human reactions, hormonal changes\\rightarrow behavioral changes$, which align more with principles. Economics, on the other hand, answers with $variable1\\rightarrow variable2\\rightarrow variable3$, which is more like a process description, broader, and less aligned with principles, hence the skepticism. Psychology restricts mediation variables to human performance, while economics has no such strict restrictions, making spurious correlations highly likely. For example, in the case of vitamin C and scurvy, people long believed it was ‚Äúfruit‚Äîoranges‚Äù that mattered. The Kost Arctic expedition thought the key was fresh fruit, so they prepared no fruit but only fresh meat, and everyone ended up with scurvy. To address ‚ÄúSimpson‚Äôs Paradox,‚Äù we still need mediation effects because of the $\\boxed{mediation fallacy}$. Take the Science paper Sex Bias in Graduate Admissions: Data from Berkeley[^10] as an example. We get the following causal path diagram. Gender affects admission rates through two paths. „ÄäSex Bias in Graduate Admissions: Data from Berkeley„Äã\rDirect effect: $gender\\rightarrow admission rate$ Indirect effect: $gender\\rightarrow department\\rightarrow admission rate$, where ‚Äúdepartment‚Äù is the mediating variable. If we directly control for ‚Äúdepartment,‚Äù we show the direct effect of gender on admission rates, and the regression will indicate discrimination against women. If we only control for ‚Äústate of residence,‚Äù we show the direct effect of gender on admission rates and the indirect effect of gender-department-admission rates, indicating no discrimination against women. The completely different results are precisely Simpson‚Äôs Paradox . In the coffee example, we made a mistake by omitting a variable; here, the mistake is controlling for a ‚Äúmediating variable‚Äù. The final conclusion is that because women are more likely to apply to the most competitive departments, their admission rates appear lower, so department is an important mediating variable and should not be casually controlled. Thus, mediating variables should not be used as control variables, and if we want to distinguish between direct and mediating effects, further differentiation is needed.

Moderating Effects: Grouped Regression or Interaction Terms Found a comprehensive summary This section mainly references Regression Analysis by Xie Yu. For variables $Y$, $X_1$, $X_2$, and $D$, we have different estimation strategies. Grouped regression: $Y=\\beta_1 X_1+\\beta_2 X_2+u$, then group by D. Introduce interaction terms, with two estimation methods: $$ \\begin{cases} Y=\\beta_1 X_1+\\beta_2 X_2+\\beta_3D+\\beta_4 DX_1+u \\newline Y=\\beta_1 X_1+\\beta_2 X_2+\\beta_3DX +u \\end{cases} $$ What's the difference between interaction terms and grouped regression? Generally, interaction terms emphasize moderating effects, while grouped regression emphasizes heterogeneity. Jiang Ting (2022) believes they are the same. However, there are still some differences: First, there are cases where grouped regression is necessary, such as when discussing regional heterogeneity across east, west, north, south, and central regions. We cannot quantify their roles in interaction terms with 1-4, and repeatedly using 0-1 coding doesn‚Äôt align with control logic, so grouped regression is needed. Second, there are cases where we need to study interaction terms, i.e., substitution and complementary effects. When the equation becomes $Y=\\beta_1 X_1+\\beta_2 X_2+\\beta_3DX +u$, studying marginal effects, each other‚Äôs marginal effects are influenced by the other. Finally, when group coefficients are similar, grouped regression can also serve as a robustness test. Here are some common conclusions (though I feel these conclusions lack authoritative paper support): Statistical testing favors interaction terms because they have significance tests (though now grouped regression can also test coefficient differences for significance), are more sensitive, and use the entire sample, while grouped regression reduces sample size; Data assumptions differ, interaction terms assume only interaction-related groups have between-group differences, requiring stricter assumptions. Interaction terms require control variable coefficients to be consistent across groups, while grouped regression does not. An extended conclusion‚Äîwhen a variable interacts with all control variables, interaction term estimation and grouped regression are completely consistent. Different variables require different discussions; interaction terms can be divided into dummy-dummy interactions (recommended reference), dummy-continuous interactions, and continuous-continuous interactions, requiring specific analysis. (Basic Econometrics by Gujarati supports dummy-dummy interactions‚Äîno controversy given the prevalence of difference-in-differences.) Interaction term assumptions remain a gray area in mechanism testing. As long as your variable logic makes sense, use whichever is significant‚Äîgrouped or interaction‚Äîor better yet, use both. What kind of variables are suitable for interactions? From a mathematical perspective, addition affects intercepts, while multiplication affects slopes. From the figure, moderating effects emphasize interactions because they affect slopes along with X.\rFrom the figure, moderating effects emphasize interactions because they affect slopes along with X. Grouped regression emphasizes that X‚Äôs slope is the same, only intercepts differ, with no moderating effects, making it more suitable as a control variable. Can we delete lower-order terms? Which of the following two estimation equations should we choose? Can we remove the lower-order terms $X$ and $D$ after including the interaction term $XD$? $$ \\begin{cases} Y=\\beta_1 X_1+\\beta_2 X_2+\\beta_3 D+\\beta_4 DX_1+u\\newline Y=\\beta_1 X_1+\\beta_2 X_2+\\beta_3DX_2 +u\\end{cases} $$ The answer is that $\\beta_3 D$ should be included. In the first equation, $\\beta_4$ is indeed the net effect after controlling for $X_1$ and $D$. This can lead to ‚Äúmulticollinearity,‚Äù which can be addressed by de-meaning (subtracting the mean).

The articles on Sinology, science, and logic have once again enlightened me. Reflecting now, I‚Äôve always tried to avoid describing my initial motivation for studying economics with the term ‚Äúserving the world and benefiting the people,‚Äù and this influence stems from Wang Xiaobo. Many people would question, what‚Äôs the use of so many social science papers? Economics studies money for the implementation of monetary policy, finance is for making money. Even people often say, ‚ÄúI study economics to serve the world and benefit the people, to support the nation.‚Äù Many people frequently claim that the liberal arts are disciplines that ‚Äúcontinue the learning of past sages and bring peace for generations.‚Äù In reality, whether for personal survival or social prosperity, these reasons are all commendable. However, when we add ‚Äúuniqueness‚Äù to this logic, it leads to another meaning: the discipline implies responsibility, and this responsibility is implemented at specific points of action. So, if there is a problem that has no practical use, should we not study it? If you ask someone if studying black holes is useful, he can‚Äôt explain it clearly, but everyone already feels that the mysterious natural sciences will eventually be useful in the future. The social sciences can also answer in this way. But this reason is something I am very dissatisfied with, because the underlying motive is still ‚Äúbecause this discipline may be useful in the future, so we need to persist,‚Äù which is essentially ‚Äúserving the world and benefiting the people,‚Äù ‚Äúpragmatism,‚Äù and the ‚Äúusefulness above all‚Äù mindset. I believe that whether it‚Äôs social science or natural science, what truly motivates us to learn is a common cause, not pragmatism or utilitarianism, but the human ideals celebrated in literary works‚Äîwhy climb a mountain, because it is there. For example, Liu Cixin‚Äôs ‚ÄúSeeking the Truth,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Climbers,‚Äù Hemingway‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Old Man and the Sea‚Äù‚Ä¶ The Chinese saying ‚Äúwhen choosing between two harms, take the lesser one,‚Äù but there are always those who make choices that transcend purely utilitarian considerations. As a science fiction fan, my stance is only one: research is for solving problems, solving problems is for answering questions. We propose many questions based on practical considerations and then solve them, but some questions exist regardless of their practical implications, so we attempt to answer them. Therefore, there‚Äôs no need for any reason to study a problem; you just want to know the answer, to delve into the problem, without needing to invoke grand principles or the hardships of life, just because of two words‚Äîcuriosity is enough. Therefore, Wang Xiaobo opposes certain behaviors that excessively beautify ‚ÄúSinology,‚Äù opposes Confucius and Mencius, and admires Russell. One of the Two Chengs said that ‚Äúbenevolence and love‚Äù are like a newborn, fluffy duckling, and many people are so captivated by this mysterious realm that they can‚Äôt extricate themselves. So, do we really need to reexperience benevolence and love from the down of a duckling? Many people say that the ‚ÄúI Ching‚Äù stands at the pinnacle of predictive analytics, so they no longer pursue answers. All these are about seeking usefulness, wanting to achieve useful goals through mysterious, unfathomable means, regardless of whether there is a process, as long as it‚Äôs good , correct, and the inherited mysteriousness is deemed sufficient. I used to not understand why the phrase ‚Äúbecause the mountain is there‚Äù is often mentioned, but now I realize it‚Äôs because this phrase encapsulates this truth‚Äîthe pursuit of answers doesn‚Äôt need a reason. That is also what Wang Xiaobo said: one day when I‚Äôm no longer here, but as long as I think that there will still be people walking on this path seeking truth, I will feel happy.

Like Erjiu‚Äôs ending, the latter also finds solace and inspiration from survivors, empathizing with them as they await the arrival of spring after enduring hardship. Hence, people extol phrases like ‚Äúthe good days are still ahead‚Äù and ‚Äúthere is no winter that cannot be crossed,‚Äù because we are destined to overcome, and therefore, we face the future without fear. This is evidently a circular argument. But outside of this cycle, who will question the winter? Yu Hua‚Äôs works confront the source of suffering directly‚Äîa Cthulhu without an object to speak of. Yu zhou tan suo bian ji bu\r‚ÄúThe Mistake by the River‚Äù? Where exactly does the mistake lie? On a concrete level, Ma Zhe refuses to acknowledge the randomness of the madman‚Äôs killings, thus deviating from the truth from the outset. This exposes the villagers‚Äô reality of not being accepted by society: Ma Zhe does not believe that the madman would commit murder, so he indirectly uncovers the taboo love affairs after poetry creation, the secret cross-dressing after unjust cases, and the perverse motives behind kind adoption. The more Ma Zhe denies madness, the more madness he uncovers. As a police officer, Ma Zhe‚Äôs pursuit of truth and adherence to logic seemed unquestionable, yet it led to greater pain and death. Ma Zhe believed in the logic of life, but the reality of this logic crushed him and his world. His clues only led from one person‚Äôs madness to another‚Äôs. A person who refused to acknowledge the rationality of madness ended up surrounded by it, and eventually succumbed to madness himself. This was the mistake he made. From an abstract perspective, what is madness? It is suffering, akin to good people not receiving their due rewards, efforts not being reciprocated, and people seeking pain amidst happiness. It is the kind-hearted family giving birth to a disabled child. Ma Zhe refused to believe that the madman was the murderer, just as he refused to believe that his own child could become a madman. When Ma Zhe finally accepted the reality that the madman was the culprit, he had to raise his own child, who had become mad. The river is the bond of fate. Xu Liang from the Director‚Äôs Cut runs by the river, the old lady dies by the river, the poet-teacher dies by the river, the child dies by the river. They bury their secrets by the riverside. ‚ÄúMadman, murder case, riverside, rain curtain, life‚Äù are strung together in a strange, low-probability manner. The audience may question how such low-probability events could be coincidental; there must be the hand of a double destiny! We try to understand fate, but in the end, we are trapped by fate.

Probability Theory: Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem What you think of as ‚Äúchance‚Äù is often embedded in ‚Äúnecessity.‚Äù Someone necessarily wins the lottery; it‚Äôs just that person chance is you. Reference: Mao Shisong‚Äôs ‚ÄúProbability Theory and Mathematical Statistics‚Äù2, sequences of random variables have two modes of convergence: convergence in probability and convergence in distribution. Convergence in Probability: $\\bbox[#def,5px,border: 1px solid]{ x\\stackrel{P}{\\longrightarrow}c }$ For example, when flipping a coin, the initial frequency of heads may deviate greatly from $\\frac{1}{2}$, but as the number of flips increases, the frequency approaches the probability. Frequency statistics have become one of the methods to determine probability3. Various versions of the Law of Large Numbers, $\\boxed{ Law of Large Numbers }$ essentially say the same thing: as the number of experiments $n$ increases, the probability of the deviation $\\small \\frac{S_n}{n}-P$ being greater than a predetermined value $\\varepsilon$ decreases. Whether it‚Äôs the Bernoulli (Bernoulli) Law of Large Numbers, Chebyshev‚Äôs Law of Large Numbers, Markov‚Äôs Law of Large Numbers, or Khinchin‚Äôs Law of Large Numbers, they all essentially describe the same thing4. Convergence in Distribution: $\\bbox[#def,5px,border: 1px solid]{ x\\stackrel{F}{\\longrightarrow}c }$ Strong convergence in distribution is pointwise convergence, while weak convergence removes discontinuities and only considers the continuous distribution of $F(x)$. Denoted as $ \\mathbb{P}(X_n\\leqslant a)\\to\\mathbb{P}(X\\leqslant a) $, which is $ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}F_n (x)=F (x)$. The $\\boxed{ Central Limit Theorem }$ states that under certain conditions5, the distribution function of the sum of independent random variables $Y_n=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{X_i}$ approaches a normal distribution. Interesting knowledge about function distributions6 Assume there is a random variable that follows a binomial distribution. When it tends to the limit, with the expectation equal to the variance, it becomes a Poisson distribution. The intervals between random variables follow an exponential distribution. The nth variable corresponds to the gamma distribution in the horizontal coordinate.

With the proposal of the Solow model, development economics researchers raised questions: Since each economy has its own steady state and balanced growth path, and at the same time, less developed economies grow quickly while advanced economies slow down, the question is, will the economic growth of all economies converge in the end? $$ \\begin{cases} \\beta\\text{-convergence} \\begin{cases} \\text{Absolute Convergence} \\ \\text{Conditional Convergence} \\ \\text{Club Convergence} \\end{cases} \\ \\sigma\\text{-convergence} \\end{cases} $$ $\\beta$-convergence: $\\boxed{\\beta\\text{ Absolute Convergence}}$ assumes that regardless of the initial conditions of the economy, due to the faster development of the weaker and slower development of the stronger, the economy will eventually converge to the same level.

Convergence Speed It seems like a mathematical concept from real analysis, but I first learned it in Romer‚Äôs ‚ÄúAdvanced Macroeconomics,‚Äù so I‚Äôve categorized it under economics. I looked it up on Wikipedia (Rate of convergence), which is mainly applied in algorithm optimization and deep learning fields. If a sequence $x_k$ converges to $L$, the expression $\\mu$ is the rate of convergence. $$ \\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\frac{|x_{k+1}-L|}{|x_k-L|^q}=\\mu $$ When $q=1$ in the equation, it is linear convergence, where the convergence speed is the ratio of the numerical difference to the convergence point between times $t$ and $t+1$. Imagine a race. We measure speed by comparing the distance from the starting point. Convergence is like anxiously waiting for the school bell.

Econometric Equations (1) Absolute Convergence Barro and Martin (1991)7 proposed the test equation for absolute $\\beta$ convergence based on Baumol (1986)8. $$ \\small \\frac{1}{T}\\left[\\log(y_{i,t+T}) - \\log(y_{i,t})\\right] = \\alpha - \\frac{(1 - e^{-\\beta T})}{T} \\log(y_{i,t}) + \\varepsilon_i $$ Where $i$ represents the $i$th region, $t$ is the initial period, $t+T$ is the final period, $T$ is the length of the observation period, $y_{i,t}$ is the per capita GDP of region $i$ in period $t$, and $\\beta$ represents the convergence speed. If $\\beta \u003e 0$, it indicates that the differences in economic development between regions will gradually disappear, eventually reaching the same steady state. OLS Regression Statistics Chart, Data from EU Regions (Source: Barro and Martin, 1991)\rThe above formula is derived from the neoclassical growth model (i.e., the Solow model). Personally, I find that domestic descriptions of convergence regression variance are much clearer and more concise. Here, I refer to Peng Guohua (2005)9‚Äôs regression equation: $$ g = c + \\beta \\ln y_0 + \\varepsilon $$ Where $g$ is the growth rate, $c$ is the constant term, $y_0$ is the actual output, and $\\varepsilon$ is the error term. When $\\beta \u003c 0$, it indicates that the growth rate $g$ is negatively correlated with the economic level $y_0$, consistent with our assumption that ‚Äúhigh-level economies grow slower, while low-level economies grow faster.‚Äù (2) Conditional Convergence Barro and Martin (1992)10 proposed the test equation for conditional $\\beta$ convergence based on the absolute $\\beta$ convergence test equation: $$ \\small \\frac{1}{T}\\left[\\log(y_{i,t+T}) - \\log(y_{i,t})\\right] = \\alpha - \\frac{(1 - e^{-\\beta T})}{T} \\log(y_{i,t}) + \\lambda X_{i,t} + \\varepsilon_{i,t} $$ The conclusions and parameter meanings are the same as those for absolute convergence, as conditional convergence implies that economic growth is related to the structural environment of the economy, hence the inclusion of $X_{i,t}$ as control variables. The inconvenience of introducing control variables $X_{i,t}$ is that we have to study exogeneity again. (3) Club Convergence In groups with similar economic characteristics and similar growth paths, convergence exists within the group, but not between different economic groups. This phenomenon is called club convergence (Durlauf, 1995; Galor, 1996). $$ \\frac{1}{T}\\left[\\log(y_{i,t+T}) - \\log(y_{i,t})\\right] = \\alpha + \\beta \\log(y_{i,t}) + \\lambda D + \\varepsilon_{i,t} $$ The variable meanings are the same as above, except that convergence is indicated only when $\\beta \u003c 0$, where $D_{i,t}$ is a dummy variable, i.e., grouping, such as all of East Asia following the same development path, or several cities developing as port cities. An interesting study I found is modeling based on clustering criteria, such as using the ‚Äúmiddle-income trap‚Äù as a clustering criterion11. Du (2017) (who is from Shandong University) introduced a Stata package to perform the econometric convergence test and club clustering algorithm by Phillips and Sul (2007)1213.

Before the advent of the camera, painters pursued realism. Correspondingly, the Romanticism of the Renaissance was a style characterized by exaggerated creativity. Romanticism isn‚Äôt just a genre; it‚Äôs an impulse! Any work can have a touch of romanticism. With the emergence of the camera, painters began to contemplate the differences between painting and photography. People started to deliberately emphasize rough brushstrokes and ‚Äúmental tones.‚Äù Among them is a unique brushstroke\rMost styles of painting in the modern era are essentially ‚Äúreconstructions‚Äù of the real world, combining brushstrokes with the artist‚Äôs understanding of the world‚Äôs essence. Futurists: Science can explain everything; it‚Äôs a symbol of order. We should use orderly geometric shapes to compose our works and showcase the beauty of rationality. Symbolists: All cognition is a product of society. To stimulate people‚Äôs thinking on a topic, we need to transfer the same object to different scenarios. For example, moving a spoon from a table to the ceiling, or replacing actors in a stage play with wooden stakes in an open-air mine. Our inexplicability is precisely to alienate things, thus provoking people‚Äôs reflection (classic anthropological alienation). Impressionists: Colors, light, and time are constantly changing. What we paint is just the light atmosphere at a specific moment in time. We need to learn to observe, to observe the changes in color and light of an object under various conditions. (That‚Äôs why Monet painted over 300 versions of ‚ÄúWater Lilies‚Äù). Pointillists: The colors of light can be expressed by the three primary colors. By letting the three primary colors form dots that overlap and eventually create an image. Collage Art: Reassemble everyday objects to express ideas, and materials such as newspapers and posters can also be reassembled into a new work. Dada Art: Gradually entering the realm of conceptual deconstruction and reflection. All concepts should be deconstructed and reexamined. So, in the eyes of Dadaists, a toilet becomes a fountain, and a clothes hanger becomes an octopus. apple man\rOnce we understand the artists‚Äô principles and backgrounds, previously perplexing images seem to become more understandable. Nowadays, many ‚Äúperformance art‚Äù pieces and inexplicable paintings may make people feel that art is just empty boasting. I think, in fact, discussions about painting concepts ultimately lead to abstraction. Just like some branches of mathematics, when taken to certain depths, lose the concept of numbers. Painters abstract concepts and expressions themselves, and then use incomprehensible actions to express themselves. It seems that abstraction through paintings is a trend in the so-called avant-garde. First-class art is intoxicating in appearance, or concise and easy to understand, and the icing on the cake is understanding the connotation. Second-rate art is incomprehensible in appearance, but once you understand the connotation, you can see the light. Third-rate art is boring in appearance and pretends to be sophisticated. I believe that aesthetic appreciation in art is also a process of interaction between knowledge and images. Therefore, interpreting the same painting with the background of the times can lead to different personal perceptions. Perhaps, the reader‚Äôs perspective on the appreciation of the work itself becomes an art alongside the era. The main benefit an artist or authority brings is simply that their status allows us to have the patience to think about and try to understand their actions. Therefore, when facing artists, we choose to think rather than blindly follow them.

People yearn for the medieval times much like they long for the idyllic countryside‚Äîa utopia that exists solely in the realm of imagination. Strangely enough, there are those who find solace in pursuing a different path, even if it leads them astray‚Äîpeople like myself, who revel in the unconventional. Such individuals find joy in this ‚Äúquirky‚Äù compendium. What I mean to say is, if you‚Äôre not the type to delve into ‚Äústrict history‚Äù or merely a gamer seeking entertainment, then perhaps you‚Äôre the kind to seek philosophy in games and dark humor in history. Well, congratulations, you‚Äôre ready to embark on your journey through the medieval world. This book is not suited for those seeking a detailed understanding of the medieval period. It follows the main theme of ‚Äúheroic dragon-slaying role-playing,‚Äù presenting popular medieval tales and literature in a digestible format. This implies that there‚Äôs no obligation to provide a comprehensive educational framework covering the economic, cultural, and political aspects of the era. Unlike traditional history books that offer analytical viewpoints, this book occasionally offers the author‚Äôs perspective on the use of historical sources. Are laws reliable? People of that time didn‚Äôt necessarily follow them; the focus lies more on exploring the motives behind lawmaking. Are diaries sincere? Many medieval individuals clandestinely recorded their mastery of magic or their various exploits, yet some narratives and their subsequent personal records harbor hidden contradictions. HOW TO SLAY A DRAGON: A Fantasy Hero‚Äôs Guide to the Real Middle Ages\rThis book primarily focuses on elucidating the everyday aspects of life during the medieval period: From unicorns to the fantastical creatures of the time, From troubadours to the ballads of the era, From cursed marshes to poorly managed latrines, From courtship to the moral codes of the time. It delves into topics such as medieval bathroom practices, dental hygiene, road systems, inns, and even rustic romance. What captivates the reader is the contrast between the titles and the content, drawing them into the next intriguing chapter. The examples provided by the author are remarkably close to life and imbued with humor. For instance, were there really records of religious miracles and magical occurrences in the medieval period? Indeed, there are documented instances of individuals keeping diaries (in the form of autobiographies) detailing their studies in magic, which were later studied by others‚Äîresulting in a profound sense of shame. As for the various daily occurrences in medieval life, the author doesn‚Äôt shy away from employing witty and satirical language. Take, for instance, the scenario of the three individuals in a duel, where the one who initially arrived naked ends up surviving‚Äîa lesson for all: ‚ÄúIn the medieval times, always carry a weapon in secret.‚Äù Regarding unclean neighbors, the sentiment is expressed as ‚ÄúNeighbors will be neighbors; they‚Äôre not cursed until their excrement blocks the streets, at which point perhaps they do become cursed‚Äîcurses may be false, but filth is real.‚Äù And in the Byzantine Empire, where bizarre tragedies are anything but unusual, nothing seems out of the ordinary. As the author doubles as a narrator and a guide through the adventures of the hero, these humorous remarks infuse the book with a strong sense of interactivity. Moreover, the titles themselves carry a distinct flavor reminiscent of Japanese anime RPGs. While microhistory books like ‚ÄúSoulstealers: The Chinese Sorcery Scare of 1768‚Äù and ‚Äú1587, a Year of No Significance: The Ming Dynasty in Decline‚Äù meticulously analyze individual historical records to support overarching themes, this book takes a different approach.

Initially, I read the electronic version, but after finishing it, I was so impressed that I immediately bought the physical book. The book truly lives up to its preface in the first edition: the examples are vivid and interesting, and it skillfully explains the tricky variations of each exam point, leaving a deep impression. Special thanks to the github re-book project team (2019) for the $\\LaTeX$ typesetting of the book. As an introductory book on probability theory and mathematical statistics, we do not want to lead students directly into the mathematical paradise. Instead, we first explore the various landscapes of probability and statistics in the ‚Äúwild,‚Äù and then enter the mathematical paradise, making various concepts and theorems well-grounded and meaningful. This approach allows students to find the book interesting and feel that it is different from reading a typical mathematics textbook. Of course, we also pay great attention to the proofs and discussions of some regularities extracted from randomness, as only by understanding these can one feel them more profoundly. (First Edition Preface) Because it is so fascinating, I couldn‚Äôt help but record some of the excellent examples from the book on Zhihu.

First, substitute the villagers‚Äô perspective of conditional probability, and assume initial values: $$ \\begin{cases} \\text{The boy is trustworthy and lies: } P(A|B)=0.1\\\\ \\text{The boy is untrustworthy and lies: } P(A|\\overline{B})=0.5 \\end{cases}\\ $$ After the boy lies, the villagers will reassess their trust in the boy, so the premise is that the boy has lied, and trust is represented as $P(B|A)$. After the first lie, substitute into Bayes‚Äô equation: $$ \\begin{align*} P(B|A) \u0026 = \\frac{P(B)P(A|B)}{P(B)P(A|B) + P(\\bar B)P(A|\\bar B) } \\\\ \u0026 = \\frac{0.8\\times0.1}{0.8\\times0.1 + 0.2\\times0.5} = 0.444 \\end{align*} $$ That is, the villagers‚Äô trust in the boy changes as follows: $$ \\text{Prior Probability} \\begin{cases} P(B)=0.8\\\\ P(\\overline{B})=0.2 \\end{cases} \\stackrel{\\text{After one lie}}{\\longrightarrow}\\text{Posterior Probability} \\begin{cases} P(B|A)=0.444\\\\ P(\\overline{B}|A)=0.556 \\end{cases} $$ That is, after one lie, the villagers‚Äô trust in the boy becomes $P({B})=0.444$ and $P({B})=0.556$. Similarly, after the second lie, trust becomes: $$ P(B|A) = \\frac{0.444\\times0.1}{0.444\\times0.1 + 0.556\\times0.5} = 0.138 $$ In summary, after two lies, the villagers‚Äô trust in the boy changes from $P(B)=0.8$ to $P(B)=0.138$. This is how repeated lies lead to a loss of trust. Why Bayesian Estimation is Great The meaning of Bayesian estimation is to adjust probability values based on parameters at any time. Like Sherlock Holmes‚Äô reasoning, first list all possibilities, and as evidence increases, update the belief values for each possibility. Another school of thought is the frequentist approach, where the real parameters are fixed, and a large amount of data is used to estimate the real parameters. From this perspective, Bayesian estimation is even a worldview. ","date":"2023-08-01","objectID":"/en/posts/probability/:3:2","tags":["Probability Theory"],"title":"Estimating œÄ with a Needle?

Taxing first and then refunding sounds like a bizarre plan, but think about it: what if we consider the deposit for ‚Äúshared bikes or shared power banks‚Äù as a tax? The deposit, like Varian‚Äôs oil tax, is paid first and then refunded. The deposit is an additional charge on top of the shared bike or power bank usage fee, just as the oil tax is an additional charge on gasoline consumption. Both the deposit and the oil tax are fully refunded. The original question: Will taxing oil and then refunding it to consumers change their consumption? Transformed into: If the deposit for shared bikes or power banks increases, will consumers‚Äô consumption change? Let‚Äôs assume there are two types of people in the market: One is a wealthy person who has 100 dollars a day, spends 50 dollars on personal consumption, and can even spend the other 50 dollars on ‚ÄúCrazy Fridays‚Äù for others. The other is a worker who only has 50 dollars a day, barely enough for personal consumption, with no extra money for KFC. For both groups, when the deposit for shared power banks is 0 dollars, each consumes two power banks a day. But one day, the deposit for power banks increases to 50 dollars! The wealthy person doesn‚Äôt care; they still spend 100 dollars on two power banks and continue to enjoy life after receiving the refund. The worker, however, is in trouble. The deposit has increased from 0 dollars to 100 dollars, but they only have 50 dollars! Unless they borrow money, they can‚Äôt afford the deposit. As a result, the worker reduces their consumption from two power banks a day to one. So in this market, even though the deposit is refunded, the number of power banks rented daily has decreased from 4 to 3. The increase in deposit has no effect on the wealthy person‚Äôs consumption $x$, but the worker‚Äôs consumption has decreased from $x$ to $x\\prime$. The average market consumption change: $\\frac{x+x}{2} \\Rightarrow\\frac{x+x^{\\prime}}{2}$, and indeed, market consumption has decreased! This is why Varian says in the book ( Original English textbook link: Intermediate Microeconomics) That‚Äôs because he is average, not because of any causal connection Varian distinguishes between ‚Äúconsumers‚Äù and ‚Äúaverage consumers.‚Äù That is, the wealthy person (consumer) in the market is not affected by the deposit, but the worker is, and as a result, the overall market (average consumer) consumption decreases.

But there is another explanatory perspective, treating the policy as forcing everyone to engage in intertemporal consumption.

Mathematical Explanation Once the ‚Äúnon-mathematical explanation‚Äù is understood, we can look at the mathematical analysis provided in the book. The entire tax burden is shifted to consumers, meaning the price of gasoline rises. (Because some workers cannot afford the deposit, even though it will be refunded.) Taxing and then refunding ultimately leaves income unchanged. The first point indicates that the substitution effect occurs: as the price of gasoline rises, consumers are willing to spend more on other goods instead of gasoline. Therefore, the final consumption of oil by consumers must be $x^\\prime$ after the price change, not the original $x$. The second point indicates that, overall, income has not changed, so there is no income effect. This is why the book distinguishes between ‚Äúconsumers‚Äù and ‚Äúaverage consumers.‚Äù The average consumer‚Äôs reaction to taxing and refunding is to reduce consumption, as they perceive gasoline as more expensive, with the tax burden shifted as $t$. $$ \\begin{cases} \\text{Before: }px+y=m\\newline \\text{Now: }(p+t)x\\prime+y\\prime=m+tx\\prime \\end{cases} $$ Diagram\r","date":"2023-07-06","objectID":"/en/posts/fla/:3:0","tags":["Microeconomics"],"title":"Analysis of the Tax Refund Case in Varian‚Äôs \"Microeconomics\"","uri":"/en/posts/fla/"},{"categories":["Film and TV"],"content":" It was only after a long, long time that I began to understand‚Äîin the sorrow of the last emperor, ‚Äúthe last‚Äù far outweighs ‚Äúthe emperor.‚Äù When the whip of history drives forward, it does not stop lashing because of the traveler‚Äôs identity; it simply, monotonously repeats the actions of closing and opening doors, always ready to close the next one.

AI has not brought much displacement; the industries it has spawned are mostly tools. Recently, the most popular thing is that a simple bug can defeat KATAgo by exploiting a small weakness, showing that once a bug in AI is found, it can paralyze everything. Therefore, AI can only be a tool. For example, no matter how much autonomous vehicle technology develops, as long as the road shape remains unchanged, it will never pass review. Language models are only a part of intelligence, and it is hard to say directly that they can surpass humans.

During the boring time of the Chinese New Year holidays, I finally finished reading ‚ÄúThe Calling of Spirits.‚Äù In 1768, a panic of sorcery called ‚ÄúThe Calling of Spirits‚Äù swept across the land of the Qing Empire. Surprisingly, the terms ‚Äúprosperous era‚Äù and ‚Äúsorcery‚Äù became parallel concepts.

In summary, the ‚ÄúCalling of Spirits‚Äù case involves three main threads: The panic and public dissemination of sorcery among common people. The political concerns and exploitation of the ‚ÄúCalling of Spirits‚Äù by the emperor. The bureaucratic dilemma of officials fearing pressure from above and below.

The ‚ÄúCalling of Spirits‚Äù case involved an unheard-of form of sorcery where one‚Äôs money could be stolen simply by cutting off their braid. For the common people, who believed in the existence of the soul, ‚Äúcalling of spirits‚Äù was a widely circulated folk custom, providing a foundation for belief in sorcery. China‚Äôs deep-rooted local sentiment made it easier for people to demonize outsiders. At this time, Chinese construction workers and the monk class, due to the transient nature of their professions, were particularly susceptible to suspicion. The expansion of the ‚ÄúCalling of Spirits‚Äù incidents originated from these transient populations.

Faced with sorcery, the Qing Dynasty faced inherent cultural contradictions. Despite Emperor Qianlong‚Äôs early attempts to distance the ‚Äúhair-cutting case‚Äù from political dissent, the braided queue remained a symbol of Manchu identity. As rulers of the Qing Dynasty, their attitude reflected not only fear of rebellion but also dissatisfaction with the Sinicization of the Manchus. The inherent weakness of feudal dynasties was evident in the legal ambiguity regarding ‚Äúsorcery.‚Äù While the emperor and the state used the concept of ‚Äúdivine right‚Äù to bolster their legitimacy, sorcery was seen as both a miracle and a threat. This led to vague laws regarding sorcery in the Qing Dynasty, which had to be established nonetheless.

The bureaucratic system of the Qing Dynasty was rife with inequality.The core of Kong Lifai‚Äôs research lies in the impact of this system on information dissemination and policy implementation. The emperor regarded bureaucrats as tools, establishing various channels. Although the ceremonial language was cumbersome, it served both as a means of communication and a way to delineate status. Without the ceremonial aspects, the emperor would struggle to bear the burden of pushing through tasks, yet reverting to formality also led to inefficiency. In the ‚Äúhair-cutting case,‚Äù the most prominent aspect was the prevalence of officials‚Äô evaluations filled with flattery and mutual protection. Under the system of mutual recommendation for official selection, actions at all levels were aligned along an axis of interests. Bureaucratic evaluations manifested as a strip, with flattery revolving around imperial power. Qing officials‚Äô evaluations were brief and crude, with achievements attributed to ‚Äúevents.‚Äù What‚Äôs terrifying is that officials had the ability to control these events, and the moral risk of self-directed deception occurred easily under the desire for positive imperial evaluations and mutual concealment among peers. From this moment on, imperial evaluations had never had such power to influence the course of events, yet Qianlong‚Äôs decisions remained loyal to his position as a Manchu emperor. Was this management by an ethnic minority a political distortion? Regardless, as the ‚Äúcalling souls‚Äù case shattered, the actors on the stage retreated one by one.

Faced with the same ‚Äúsoul calling‚Äù and hair-cutting incidents, the experiences of different social classes are completely different. Kong Feili has conducted a perfect ‚Äúheterogeneity‚Äù analysis and class analysis of society. It is worth noting that this result is a structured classification rather than a combination of multiple quantities. Therefore, I believe that the discussion of ‚ÄúThe Soul Calling‚Äù should be separated from ‚ÄúThe Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind‚Äù. The ‚ÄúSoul Calling‚Äù case has many similarities with the characteristics of the Qing Dynasty. This is an explanation of the decline and turning point under the prosperous age, and it is also the inevitable result of the historical operation of the feudal dynasty. Although the case seems to revolve around the emperor‚Äôs attitude, the emperor remains faithful to his class. However, China at this time had not yet achieved harmonious integration of its diverse cultural groups, leading to distortions in the operation of power. How could absurd sorcery emerge in a ‚Äúprosperous age‚Äù? Perhaps coincidence is just a turning point in history. The big fish lurking beneath the surface of the water has never stopped swimming, just casting fleeting shadows in the rise and fall of governance.

Excessive drinking is always harmful to health. Here are some personal insights based on my experiences. The banquets I encountered in several counties generally followed four stages: Stage One: Personal introductions, after which individuals start drinking voluntarily. Stage Two: Mutual exchanges and inviting others to drink, one-on-one. Stage Three: Speech by leaders, giving collective advice, followed by a group toast where everyone stands and toasts around the table. Stage Four: As the banquet wraps up, exchanging WeChat contacts. Strategies for drinking should be flexible and adapted according to each stage. Spell casting preparation: Emphasize repeatedly that you don‚Äôt drink, haven‚Äôt drunk before, to reduce the difficulty level as much as possible. Stage One: Usually, when standing up to introduce yourself, you can start pouring a bit of the drink from the small or medium-sized glass. Alternatively, you can discreetly pour it out under the table beforehand. When raising the glass, use your hand to cover the side of the glass (fully covering the glass would look too fake!), so that others can‚Äôt see the level of the drink, thinking it‚Äôs in the pouring state. Stage Two: Because it‚Äôs a university student survey, you can eat and drink casually without knowing the rules. Pay attention to see if there‚Äôs milk or tea cups on the table. Drink water to one-third full, hold the wine in your mouth after the toast (be careful not to puff your mouth up! Tongue might be quite rough), pretend to drink the beverage, and spill the wine into the beverage. If no beverage is available, the filled bowl of rice or soup is the best hiding tool When others interject to add to the conversation, it‚Äôs also a good opportunity for a small move. Typically, at a drinking session, everyone usually watches the person speaking. Stage three: At this point, the meal is almost over and most people are at least tipsy, so they can rest assured. When toasting, cover the sides of the glass with your hands. Join the toasting group and pretend to be drinking, but no wine enters your mouth. Move around a lot. At this time, everyone is usually trying to please others and will usually not notice small movements. It is recommended to use the teachings in Liu Qian‚Äôs magic class - big movements cover up small movements to mislead the other party‚Äôs attention. For example, one hand makes movements to attract attention, and the other hand gently pours wine on the ground.

The Tourism Bureau has granted the Forbidden City the highest rating and naturally desires to do the same for Dunhuang. However, the Mogao Grottoes have not acquiesced. In former days, the Taoist king had already cast out all the gold, and the resplendent treasures rode makeshift cattle carts, wandering into foreign lands. The sedimented history pays no heed to transient hustle and bustle, while the British Museum, destined for daily foot traffic, bustles incessantly. History chuckles. Faced with vast, magnificent toys, infants find themselves bewildered. Yet, the entirety of culpability does not solely rest upon the Taoist king‚ÄîDunhuang was not unearthed in an auspicious era, and even today, I cannot easily sketch the contours of ancients. Thus, here, cultural heritage preservation and dissemination intertwine. To behold Dunhuang is to encounter Dunhuang yet not entirely Dunhuang. This journey has also lifted the veil of mystery in my mind. The image of Dunhuang, akin to the temples of the Maya, has dissolved. The Mogao Grottoes are neither a testament to the grandeur of a mysterious dynasty nor a site of blessings for unknown merchants. The ‚Äúdonors‚Äù are part of the Mogao Grottoes culture. In other words‚Äîwho carved which caves. Everything is recorded plainly! After all, without leaving names, how would the deities receive their ‚Äúpayments‚Äù? Dunhuang lacks the unsolved mysteries of the Maya, but conversely, beneath the Maya civilization, there is no deeply sedimented loess land. The establishment of the grottoes spans from the Southern and Northern Dynasties to the Yuan Dynasty, and the marginal expansion of its scale reflects the prosperity and decline of the Silk Road. From the Li family of the Tang Dynasty to nameless merchants, if you dare to dig, you can dig. There are thousands of caves, each unique. Setting aside wealth, these grottoes embrace the ‚Äúdonors‚Äù who come and go, regardless of status, place of origin, or time. Relying solely on ‚Äúflying apsaras‚Äù cannot uphold the phrase ‚ÄúChinese treasure.‚Äù The most precious aspect of Dunhuang lies in the flowing years and its unique cultural temperament. History flows over these precipitous cliffs, time flips upside down, and finally condenses at the depths of the caves. From the tiles of the Southern and Northern Dynasties to the Yuan Dynasty, patterns evolve from simple geometric shapes to rounded lotuses. Whether angry or smiling, sharp or gentle, the myriad heavenly deities and Buddhas respond to the times. The multitude of cave entrances symbolizes the interaction of communities. In the long river of history filled with wars, there indeed exists such a solid port of ethnic integration. Inside the caves, there is no strong light; instead, the mineral pigments from the Tang Dynasty cover every surface, creating a faint fluorescent effect. Most of the sculptures I observed were of figures like Shakyamuni Buddha and Guanyin. Simply speaking of the sculptures, I did not perceive any advanced craftsmanship or exquisite expressions. According to the introduction, the internal craftsmanship mainly involves unique filling methods, often utilizing local materials, with a deeper cultural significance such as the reclining Buddha in Nirvana. Observing the seated Buddha indoors is quite marvelous. Unlike viewing the Leshan Giant Buddha under the bright sunlight, leaving nothing unseen, looking up at the seated Buddha inside the cave is different. The shadows above exude a profound sense of emptiness, making the Buddha statue appear enigmatic and compelling one to kneel in reverence.
